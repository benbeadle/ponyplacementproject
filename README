NOTE: Instead of running the app locally, you can alternatively go to http://ponyplacementproject.herokuapp.com to see the same output.

To get the app running, you need to install Ruby. You can find Ruby here: http://rubyonrails.org/download

Once you have downloaded and install Ruby, you need to install both RubyGems and Rails. Instructions for both can be found at the above website.

Once you have installed all of the above, open the command prompt and navigate to the project folder you have cloned from Github. (Windows: Alternatively, you can go one folder above the app folder, hold down Shift and right click on the app folder to open the command prompt at that location.)

Once you are in the project folder command prompt, type: "rails s" or "rails server" which will then run the server.

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ and you can view the app!
