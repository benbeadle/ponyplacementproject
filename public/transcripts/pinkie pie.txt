01 01 [prolonged gasp]
01 01 Surprise! Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?
01 01 Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all "hello" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!
01 01 And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!
01 01 [kettle whistling]
01 01 Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
01 01 [with mouth full] What? It's good!
01 01 [muffled disco music]
01 01 [clock ticking]
01 01 Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited- well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?
01 01 
01 01 Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
01 01 Ooh, she's good. 
01 01 [ponies gasping]
01 01 Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty-[muffled noises]
01 02 
01 02 "The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide."
01 02 [sing-song voice] It was under "E"!
01 02 Whee! Let's go!
01 02 Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
01 02 
01 02  Bleh. Ooo! [funny noises]
01 02 Oh girls, don't you see?
01 02 [>Pinkie Pie]
01 02 When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
01 02 The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown
01 02 I'd hide under my pillow
01 02 From what I thought I saw
01 02 But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
01 02 To deal with fears at all
01 02 She said: "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
01 02 Learn to face your fears
01 02 You'll see that they can't hurt you
01 02 Just laugh to make them disappear."
01 02 Ha! Ha! Ha!
01 02 So, giggle at the ghostly
01 02 Guffaw at the grossly
01 02 Crack up at the creepy
01 02 Whoop it up with the weepy
01 02 Chortle at the kooky
01 02 Snortle at the spooky
01 02 And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha...heh...
01 02 Laaaaaaauuugh!
01 02 
01 02 How are we gonna cross this?
01 02 [distant cry]
01 02 Huh?
01 02  Now what?
01 02 Oh yeah.
01 02 One, two, three, four... There's only five!
01 02 Look at mine! Look at mine!
01 02 Whoa!
01 02 [blows her nose]  Hey, you know what this calls for?
01 02 A party!
01 02 [music and cheering ponies]
01 02 Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went  but I mean really-
01 02 
01 02 
01 03  Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala? It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!
01 03 [>Pinkie Pie]
01 03 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
01 03 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
01 03 Hip hip
01 03 Hooray
01 03 It's the best place for me
01 03 For Pinkie...
01 03 With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and piñatas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
01 03 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
01 03 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
01 03 'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever
01 03 In the whole galaxy
01 03 Wheee!
01 03 Oh thank you Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever.
01 03 Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to The Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.
01 03 Him! ...Who?
01 03 You haven't?
01 03 But Twilight's taking me.
01 03 [ponies argue]
01 03 [ponies argue]
01 03 And then I said, "Oatmeal, are you craz--" oh.
01 03 Twilight is my bestest friend
01 03 Whoopie, whoopie!
01 03 She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!
01 03 I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!
01 03 She'll give her extra ticket to the gala to me!
01 03 Yes, Twilight?
01 03 Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!
01 03 And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
01 03 And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me.
01 04  Hey...!  This makes my voice sound silly!
01 04 This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.
01 04 Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!
01 04 Appletastic!
01 04 I know.
01 04 A party!
01 04 Not since the stampede.
01 04 This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
01 04 Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
01 04 [ponies cheering]
01 04 Woo-ooo.
01 04 She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
01 04 Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?
01 04 Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.
01 04 Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
01 04 Chocolate chips.
01 04 Baking soda.
01 04 A cup of flour.
01 04 One last thing. Wheat germ.
01 04 Now that's gonna be delicious.
01 04 Free muffin sample spectacular!
01 04 [ponies: mmm, muffins]
01 04 No, not baked goods, baked bads. 
01 04 Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?
01 05 Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!
01 05 And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo.
01 05 Rainbow Dash!
01 05 Rainbow Dash.
01 05 But, but Rainbow Dash–
01 05 But–
01 05 I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
01 05  Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?
01 05 Rainbow Dash.
01 05 Hi!
01 05 Hi again.
01 05 Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
01 05 I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
01 05 Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the--
01 05 Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal.
01 05  Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups.
01 05 Oh no, you're not hurt are you?
01 05 Oh, okay, good.
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 Have you ever seen anything more hilarious? 
01 05 Aah!       
01 05 Are you  kidding?  I love to pull pranks. It's all  in good fun, and Pinkie Pie lo----oves to have  fun! 
01 05 
01 05  That'd be  I'd really  When do  I mean  When would you 
01 05 Mmm-hmm.
01 05 I don't know. This is gonna be gold.
01 05 
01 05 Aaa-choo!
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 [water splash]
01 05 Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
01 05 WHAT?  Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.
01 05 Oh,  I've got someone in mind.  The toughest around.
01 05  Oh, yes.  You're very close.
01 05 
01 05 What's a griffon?
01 05  Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?
01 05 Oh. Um, well sure, no problem. Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you--  later. (blows a party hooter very sadly)
01 05 Hey there.
01 05 It's later. And I caught up.
01 05 Hey!
01 05 Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
01 05 Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
01 05 Yeah?
01 05  Whaaa-aaa–
01 05 Hmph!
01 05 Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.
01 05 Hmm?
01 05 Jealous?
01 05 Improve my attitude? But I... D... B.. It's Gilda that... D... Are you seri... [scream of frustration]
01 05 Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. 
01 05 Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.&#160;:>Gilda
01 05 
01 05  I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.
01 05 She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.
01 05 Welcome, welcome. Welcome!
01 05 Welcome. Welcome.
01 05 Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
01 05 Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 Great.
01 05  Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
01 05 And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
01 05 [ponies cheer]
01 05 Please help yourself.
01 05 Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
01 05 You do?
01 05 [ponies chatter, birds singing]
01 05 Cake time everypony.
01 05 Now, I wonder who could've done that.
01 05 Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
01 05 Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.
01 05 We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
01 05 Wait. The poster is this--
01 05 Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
01 05 [ponies laugh]
01 05 Ooh.
01 05 I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
01 05 Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
01 05 Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
01 05 No hard feelings.
01 05 
01 05 It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.
01 05 [ponies cheer]
01 07 This calls for a celebration!
01 07 Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
01 07 Let's see, that's one, two, three, four...
01 07 Five, six...
01 07 Seven.
01 07 Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!
01 07 Huh?
01 07 He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
01 07  Oh, I mean, grrr!
01 07 Ooo! Pretty!
01 07 Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!
01 07 [pop whistles]
01 07 Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!
01 07 Whoo-hoo! I win again!
01 07 There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?
01 07 It's not very far
01 07 Just move your little rump
01 07 You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump
01 07 A hop, skip and jump,
01 07 Just move your little rump,
01 07 A hop, skip and jump,
01 07 A hop, skip and jump,
01 07 A hop, skip and jump,
01 07 A hop skip and jump,
01 07 A hop skip and jump!
01 07 Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
01 07 
01 07 
01 07 
01 07 Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
01 07 
01 07 Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
01 07 
01 07 Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing.
01 07 [busted horn]
01 07 
01 09 Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
01 09 Z-Zombie pony?!
01 09 I'm not alone in the dark.
01 09 Glance evilly this way.
01 09 And spoooooky!
01 09 And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil...stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
01 09 She's an evil enchantress
01 09 She does evil dances
01 09 And if you look deep in her eyes
01 09 She'll put you in trances
01 09 Then what will she do?
01 09 She'll mix up an evil brew
01 09 Then she'll gobble you up
01 09 In a big tasty stew
01 09 Soooo.... Watch out!
01 09 It's a work in progress.
01 09 Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
01 09 Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
01 09 Just like in my song! [Starts singing a shorter version of "Evil Enchantress"]
01 09 She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
01 09 If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
01 09 Then what will she do?
01 09 Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo watch out!
01 09 Ah pfurse!
01 09 Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
01 09 Ah am-pft!
01 09 Pf-she's gone-pft!
01 09 Nopthe.
01 09 Plis place plooks horrible!
01 09 Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
01 09 Ah. Hmm... Pbth! 
01 09  You made me speak ridiculous!
01 09 Oh my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean I love talking so much and when I couldn't talk 'cause my tongue was all 'ehhhh'. It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?
01 10 Mmm... 
01 10 Aaaaa... I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
01 10 No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home.  What's going on, Fluttershy?
01 10 UGH! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
01 10 Ugh. Now I gotta find a trombone.
01 10 A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
01 10 Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
01 10 Gals! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
01 10 Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?
01 10  And not a moment too soon.
01 10 And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
01 10 You've got a real problem alright, and a banjo is the only answer.
01 10 Twilight, we don't have much time.
01 10 Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
01 10  You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!
01 10 And you are all so stubborn.
01 10 They will be with these cymbals.  Hey! Give me those back!
01 10 I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
01 10 Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruinee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
01 10 Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you just slow down and listen to me!
01 10 Look, tambourines! If you could all just...  [tambourines shake]
01 10 I'll save you!
01 10 
01 10 Hey, what happened to the princess?
01 10 Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
01 10 Well DUH, why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
01 10 Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
01 11 We've kept our hoovsies warm at home
01 11 Time off from work to play
01 11 When the sun comes up
01 11 Its warmth and beauty will glow!
01 11 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
01 11 Helooooooo Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!
01 11 Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
01 11 Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?
01 11 Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.
01 11 Yaaaaay! 
01 11 Yippie!
01 11 Twilight, steer! Steer!
01 11 Oh boy...
01 11 
01 11 
01 11 Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
01 11 No.
01 11 But did I make you feel better?
01 11 I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hoofs on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
01 11 Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
01 12 You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
01 12 Eating cupcaaakes!
01 12 I don't have any cupcakes.
01 12  But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
01 12 [>Pinkie Pie]
01 12 All you have to do is take a cup of flour!
01 12 Add it to the mix!
01 12 Now just take a little something sweet, not sour!
01 12 A bit of salt, just a pinch!
01 12 Baking these treats is such a cinch!
01 12 Add a teaspoon of vanilla!
01 12 Add a little more, and you count to four,
01 12 And you never get your fill of...
01 12 Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
01 12 Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
01 12 Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!
01 12 Oooh, those look much better than the last batch.  Mmm...
01 12 What about that?
01 12  Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo.
01 12 We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
01 12 Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!
01 13 Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
01 13 As everypony knows, the running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.
01 13 Racers! Please take your positions!
01 13 Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it me, I'm up!
01 13 What?
01 13 Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
01 13 Climb on up.
01 13 All right, ponies, are you ready?
01 13 And they're off!
01 13 Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to My Little Ponies.
01 13 Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
01 13 Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
01 13 And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
01 13 Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck in neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash pulls at Applejack's have-it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... Roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
01 13 What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
01 13 She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.
01 13 Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.
01 13 I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?
01 13 Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
01 13 Applejack, what are you doing up here?
01 13 I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!
01 13 But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
01 13 Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck in neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack--
01 13 Oh yes, she di'id!
01 13 It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--
01 13 For last.
01 14 I love something! Something is my favorite!
01 14 Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?
01 14 Balloons?
01 14 DO IT!
01 14 More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
01 14 Whose dress is this?
01 14 All we ever want is indecision
01 14 Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
01 14 I don't believe it!
01 14 Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
01 14 She'll become a crazy cat lady!
01 14 Give her time.
01 14 We all finished your dress for you.
01 14 We're so super sorry.
01 15 Ooh!
01 15 Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
01 15 Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
01 15 The twichin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You should better duck for cover.
01 15 He just said, "nice catch" in Frog.
01 15 [frog croaks]
01 15 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 15 Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
01 15 Nah! I could just see it.
01 15 [Pinkie Pie skips away singing]
01 15 My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
01 15 It's okay, my tail stopped twitching.
01 15 [Pinkie Pie begins skipping away singing]
01 15 My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
01 15 I'll start a bath for you.
01 15 Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggling feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
01 15 No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub.
01 15 
01 15 No it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!
01 15 What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?
01 15 That's so not true Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em "combos".
01 15 Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
01 15 Uh oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
01 15 
01 15 Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay?
01 15 You don't believe because you don't understand.
01 15 Okey-dokey-lokey!
01 15 [steam stack whistling periodically]
01 15 Nopey-dopey!
01 15 Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no.
01 15 I don't control it, they just come and go.
01 15 Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
01 15 Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...
01 15 It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
01 15 Okey-dokey-lokey.  Uh-oh.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu [falls over backwards]
01 15 
01 15 Uh-huh.
01 15   Mmm... 
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 
01 15  Hey, Applejack. Whatchya doin'?
01 15 Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day, without me knowing.
01 15  Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
01 15 All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell-- Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
01 15 Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And its gonna happen... At Froggy Bottom Bog!
01 15 Uh, I'm not sure.
01 15 Okey-dokey!
01 15 [gate creaks]
01 15 [frogs croak]
01 15  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
01 15 No thanks, I'm fine.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
01 15 Woah!
01 15 What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?
01 15 Fluttershy? 
01 15 I'm so glad everything's alright.
01 15 Is that a hydra!?
01 15 
01 15 Ooph! 
01 15 Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n.
01 15 [ponies gasp]
01 15 Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
01 15 T-t-t-twilight!
01 15 [hydra chirps]
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 [ponies gasp]
01 15 [hydra roars]
01 15 T-t-t-twilight! You have to jump!
01 15 You'll be fine!
01 15 Its your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
01 15 I knew you could do it, Twilight!
01 15 
01 15 That wasn't it.
01 15 The hydra wasn't the doozy.
01 15 [Hydra spits]
01 15 I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
01 15 Dunno, but it just wasn't it.
01 15 [kettle whistles]
01 15 Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
01 15 Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. Ooh!  That was it. That's the doozy.
01 15 You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was!
01 15 [Pinkie Pie skips off, singing]
01 15 
01 15 Honk!
01 15 There it goes again.
01 15 You never know.
01 15 [jet engine sound]
01 15 
01 16 
01 16 It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Woah, woah, WooooaaAAAAHH!
01 16 OOH! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean COME ON! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!
01 16 You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going soo fast... BOOM! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
01 16 Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
01 16 A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
01 16 It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
01 16 Sure did!
01 16 Haha. Pretty cool, huh?
01 16 Yes!
01 16  Spicyyyyyy!...
01 16 
01 16 We still love you.
01 19 Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
01 19 Ow!
01 19 Wait for me! Wheee!
01 19 I can't believe you got all these gems!
01 20 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
01 20  We won't say a word!
01 20 Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
01 20 FOREVER!
01 20 How'd it go? How'd it go?
01 20 FOREVER!
01 20 FOREVER!
01 20 Mmm... Juicy!
01 20 [(Shows using gestures) Zipping her mouth, locking it with the key, digging a hole, burring the key in that hole, building a house atop that hole and moving into that house.]
01 20 Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house up top the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house atop the hole.
01 20  And you were doing so well.
01 21 Awwww!
01 21  No, are you asleep yet?
01 21  Oh yeah! 
01 21  What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
01 21  Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
01 21 Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
01 21 She's not a tree, Dashy!
01 21 Oooh, looky! Now they're doing TRICKS!
01 21 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a back-flip!... Or... Just jump?
01 21 Boo!
01 21 Ah'ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're goood.
01 21 I do?
01 21 I am?
01 21 Oh my gosh, so am I!
01 21 Mmm!  Before we finish EATING? Are you loco in the coco?!
01 21 Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?
01 21 Huh?
01 21 Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
01 21 Hi guys!
01 21 We didn't!
01 21 Hey! I've got an idea!
01 21 We may be divided
01 21 But of you all, I beg
01 21 To remember we're all hoofed
01 21 At the end of each leg
01 21 No matter what the issue
01 21 Come from wherever you please
01 21 All this fighting gets you nothing
01 21 But hoof and mouth disease
01 21 Arguing's not the way
01 21 Hey, come out and play!
01 21 It's a shiny, new day
01 21 So, what do you say?
01 21 You gotta share
01 21 You gotta care
01 21 It's the right thing to do
01 21 You gotta share
01 21 You gotta care
01 21 And there'll always be a way through
01 21 Both our diets, I should mention
01 21 Are completely vegetarian
01 21 We all eat hay and oats
01 21 Why be at each other's throat?
01 21 You gotta share
01 21 You gotta care
01 21 It's the right thing to do
01 21 And there'll always be a way
01 21 Thro-o-o-o-ugh!
01 21 Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
01 21 Wah-ahh! Woah-oo-oo-oo-ooah!
01 21 HEY! That's what I said!
01 21 
01 22 Cookies, candies and pies, oh my! [pie in the face] Oooh! Chocolate Fountainy goodness! [Head in choclate fountain, choclate hardens and eats it] You gonna eat that?! Hey!
01 22 Hi!
01 22 
01 22 [Philomena bursts into flames]
01 22 No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?
01 23 You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
01 23 Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
01 23 Alright!
01 23 My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville. We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling.  There were only rocks. We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden...
01 23 
01 23 I never felt joy like that before. It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever. And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?
01 23 And that's how Equestria was made.
01 23 Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
01 23 I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
01 23 We all owe our cutie marks to you!
01 23 I love you, guys!
01 24 Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
01 24 Mmm. Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!
01 24 And now the punch has been... spiked!
01 24 Oh, what a fantastical, fluffelicious feathery little friend! I'm... HOOked!
01 24 [everybody laughs]
01 24 I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!
01 24 Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche! [pronounced phonetically]
01 24 Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
01 25 [rasping voice] Next time, I think I’ll just pass out written invitations.
01 25 &#8203;&#91;&#8203;<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>&#8203;&#93;&#8203;
01 25 Hey, girls!
01 25  Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you can make it to Gummy’s party.
01 25 Aw! It’s just a boring old apple. Don’t worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
01 25 I can’t tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn’t be a surprise.
01 25 Nope! Something new. It’s Gummy’s favorite. Ooh, this is my jam!
01 25 Having fun?
01 25 They’re always the best parties ’cause my best friends are always there! C’mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It’s your birthday! Go, Gummy! It’s your birthday!
01 25 You sure you don’t wanna stay? There’s still some cake left.
01 25  We should do this again soon!
01 25 It’s soon!
01 25 You said we should have another party soon, and… it’s soon! Here’s your invitation!
01 25 All our bestest friends are invited, and there’s gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
01 25 Yes, indeedy!
01 25 I understand. Your studies come first. But don’t worry, we’ll be sure to save you some cake.
01 25 Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn’t hit the books. You should really just read them.
01 25 Who’s ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It’s an invitation to “Gummy’s After-Birthday” party this afternoon. There’s gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
01 25 That’s funny. That’s just what Twilight said, and the answer is, “Yes! It’s this afternoon!”
01 25 Okey dokey lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.
01 25 Gummy’s after-birthday party is this afternoon. I’m delivering the invitations.
01 25 It’s so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
01 25 I know it’s short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
01 25 Don’t be silly, your hair doesn’t look dirty.
01 25 Nope!
01 25 Huh… No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.
01 25 Yes! As in, this afternoon this afternoon!
01 25  Both of you?
01 25 Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who’re you house-sitting for?
01 25 Harry?
01 25 That’s strange. I know just about everypony around here.
01 25 A bear?
01 25 Wait! There’s a bear around here who lives in a house?
01 25 He’s vacationing at the beach?
01 25 Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies, and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like…  excuses!
01 25 That doesn’t look like studying… or hitting!
01 25 But… we’re friends. What wouldn’t Twilight want me to know anything about?  She's coming back.
01 25 Time to get to the bottom of things!  I think our cover’s been blown! We’ll need a new disguise.
01 25 I thought everypony loved my parties.
01 25 Rainbow Dash! Wait!
01 25 Where’re you going?!
01 25 What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
01 25 What's in those bags?!
01 25 I know you're IN THERE!
01 25 Mind if I… take a look inside the barn?
01 25 Rainbow Dash just went in there.
01 25 Okey… dokey… lokey.
01 25 Secrets and lies! It’s all secrets and lies with those ponies! They’re up to something, Gummy! Something they don’t want me to know about! Well, I’m gonna know about it! I’m gonna know about it big time! And I know just who’s gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it BIG TIME!
01 25 It’s all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk.
01 25 No, no, no. Talk about our friends.
01 25 Grr! No! You’re not understanding me! I want you to confess!
01 25 Confess!
01 25 And?
01 25 Aaand?
01 25 No! No! No! NO!
01 25 Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don’t like my parties, and they don't want to be my friends anymore! 
01 25 Ah-ha! I knew it! [balloon deflating noise] Oh no, my friends don’t like my parties and they don’t want to be my friends anymore.
01 25 
01 25 Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
01 25 Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr. Turnip. 
01 25 Why, thank you, Rocky.
01 25 I’m so glad Sir Lintsalot. 
01 25 Anything for you, Madame Le Flour
01 25 Oh, they’re not so bad.
01 25 [low string instrument whine]
01 25 Oh, c’mon now. “Losers” might be a little strong, don’cha think?
01 25 Well, it was pretty rude...
01 25 It was, wasn’t it?
01 25 You know what? I’m not gonna speak to them ever again. And I’m not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don’t deserve to be invited to my parties.  Not after the way they’ve been acting.
01 25 Who could that be?
01 25 I know how it goes, all right!
01 25 No thanks. I’m spending time with my real friends. Isn’t that right, Madame Le Flour?'
01 25 Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
01 25 I most certainly am not. I’m having a wonderful time right here.
01 25 No!
01 25 I said, NO!
01 25 No… I… DON’T!
01 25 Excited? EXCITED? Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
01 25 Yes! You don’t like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A “Farewell to Pinkie Pie” party!
01 25 Why? Why? WHY? Because you’ve been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that’s why!
01 25  Because it’s my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgot my own birthday?
01 25 [ponies sigh in relief]
01 25 And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
01 25 You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
01 25 You girls wouldn’t mind if we celebrated Gummy’s after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he’s pretty upset about it.
01 26 Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
01 26 What's Twilight doing?
01 26 An apple! Are we having pie?
01 26 Busy having fun!
01 26 I am here at the Grand Gala, for it is the best party
01 26 But the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie
01 26 For I am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree
01 26 Ponies playing, ponies dancing, with me at the Grand Gala!
01 26 To whoop!
01 26 The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy! [anxious noise] GOTTA DANCE!
01 26 [sings to the tune of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow]
01 26 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
01 26 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
01 26 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
01 26 It's all I ever dreamed.
01 26 It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo!
01 26 It's all I ever dreamed, yippee!
01 26 I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!
01 26 
01 26 It's all I ever... dreamed?
01 26 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.
01 26 And I'm not going to...
01 26  
01 26 C'mon everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!
01 26 That's what I'm talking about
01 26 You do the Pony Pokey
01 26 You do the Pony Pokey
01 26 You do the Pony Pokey
01 26 And that's what it's all about
01 26 Yeah!
01 26 Ooooooh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!
01 26 Come on, everypony! You wanted a partey? Now it's paaarteeey! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!
01 26 STAGE DIVE!
01 26 Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you.
01 26 Laughing!
01 26 In fact, it's made it...
02 01 Why would you wanna stop this? 
02 01 Hey, what happened?
02 01 You and me both, sister! Hey!
02 01 Hey, look! We're famous!
02 01 Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!
02 01 Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
02 01 
02 01  He's standing on your head!
02 01 See you guys there!
02 01 
02 01  Whee! This is the greatest balloon garden I've ever seen! It's the first balloon garden I've ever seen, but still! Wah!
02 01 Hey, what gives?
02 01 It's different. They're laughing at me.
02 01 My friends laugh with me, not at me.
02 01 No! Stop it!
02 01 Stop laughing at me!
02 01 Happy? I don't think so.
02 01 [balloons popping]
02 01 Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?
02 01 And what are you laughing at?
02 02 Why? Need a good laugh?
02 02 And what are you laughing at?
02 02 Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!
02 02 Quit it!
02 02 Quit it!
02 02 Quit it! Stop it!
02 02 Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
02 02 What 'chu laughin' at?
02 02 This may look like fun, but it's not.
02 02 I hate libraries!
02 02 I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
02 02 It's your fault it didn't work.
02 02 Any of you! To ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
02 02  And I-I turned gray!  Can you believe it?!
02 02 Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
02 02 WHOA!
02 02 Oops.
02 02 Wait-wait-wait! 
02 03 [various shock statements]
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 [sighs of relief]
02 03 
02 03  Oh Twilight, you're such a crack-up! 
02 03 We're never gonna see Twilight again!
02 03 You can't punish her!
02 03 Mmhmm.
02 03 [All right, etc]
02 03 
02 03 ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
02 03 
02 04 [chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
02 04 Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.
02 04 Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!
02 04 Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?
02 04 And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and-[lightning zap] Bwak!
02 04 
02 04 
02 04  Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
02 04 Ah! It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
02 04 Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
02 04 Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!
02 04 Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run... [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!
02 04 [chicken squawk]
02 04 Okay.
02 04 Mmhm. [chicken squawk]
02 04 Nightmare Moon!
02 04 ...Well, duh.
02 04 I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her. How's she gonna gobble me up?
02 04 Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared.
02 04 No, I'm not. I'm a chicken. [chicken squawk]
02 06 A party will cheer you up.
02 06 Yesterday I told Mrs Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay six! I ate six corn cakes!  Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!
02 07 
02 07 We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.
02 07 Wait! Look!
02 07 Tortoise!
02 07 Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
02 07 You got your perfect pet, right?
02 07 You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!
02 08 You may be right...silly.
02 08 Mm-hm.
02 08  Spike's a ghost!
02 08 I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. 
02 08 [flowerpot shatters]
02 08 It's alright.
02 08 Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. 
02 08 [yelping and screaming]
02 09 [fades in] Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she- Hi again!
02 09 Balloons are super easy to pack.
02 09 [air let out of balloons]
02 09 Isn't it fancy pants?
02 09 Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon.
02 09 
02 09 Tada.
02 09 Let's party!
02 09 [swing music]
02 09 Mmm!
02 10 [blows party hooter] Happy birthday! Party time, woohoo!
02 10 Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
02 10 I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
02 10 [door slams]
02 10 
02 10 Back! Get back! 
02 10 [pie splats]
02 10 I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!
02 10 How dare you take the cake!
02 10 Somepony do something!
02 11 There it is! Canterlot!
02 11 I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
02 11 [cash register kaching]
02 11  ...and it's me!
02 11 Twilight, let me handle this.
02 11 
02 11 Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh wait. You're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!
02 11 Well, if you non-earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas.
02 11 No, I'm first!
02 11 
02 11 Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?
02 11 I didn't think so.
02 11 Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves – I am just about to be brilliant!
02 11 I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
02 11 Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?
02 11 Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?
02 11 
02 11 The point is...
02 11 We must find a new land!
02 11 Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction.
02 11 But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
02 11 Of course! How else could I see where I was going?
02 11 Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?
02 11 I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down.
02 11 Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh...
02 11 Whatever. You take the map, while I enjoy some relief.
02 11 The air! The trees! The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
02 11 In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville.
02 11 Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
02 11 We found our new home!
02 11 I planted mine earlier than first.
02 11 Earth!
02 11 Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?
02 11 Uh... Smart Cookie!
02 11 Oh look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere.
02 11 Finders keepers, losers weepers!
02 11 [arguing over rock]
02 11 Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
02 11 [ice cracking]
02 11 Unicorns are snobs!
02 13 I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
02 13 Two new foals for me to play with?  That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woohoo!
02 13 But I was just-
02 13 But-
02 13  Happy happy birthday, to you and you today-
02 13 Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!
02 13 Happy monthiversary to you and you today
02 13 [very quickly] I can't believe you're already a month old time sure flies doesn't it well it seems like only yesterday you were born.
02 13 But now you're a month old today, hey!
02 13 Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am!
02 13 Here I am! Here I am! Here I am! [blows raspberry]
02 13 Don't worry, they're fine!  Oogh, I mean...
02 13 Ah, no thanks. I just had a big breakfast.
02 13 Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh-
02 13 All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again?
02 13 Except food.
02 13 No, you just fed them bottles, remember?
02 13 I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
02 13 Me! Me! Pick me!
02 13 I'll do it! Pick me!
02 13 I wanna babysit! Pick me!
02 13 Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!
02 13 Ask me! Mememememememememememememe!
02 13  I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
02 13 [doors bang]
02 13 I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
02 13 Yes, I know, I will. I am.
02 13 
02 13 Whoa! That's a lot of responsi- Consider it done.
02 13 No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Everything is under control.
02 13 Uh oh.
02 13 Oh, don't cry little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie... Where's Pinkie Pie?
02 13 Oh no... I'm right here, see!
02 13 [warbling noises]
02 13 Oh, think think think... Aha!
02 13 Hey guys, watch this!
02 13 
02 13 Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight, where y'all from? Well that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because I couldn't find tractors that small!
02 13 [ba-dum tish]
02 13 Get it? Tractors that small?  The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog, and now I can't find him!
02 13 [ba-dum tish]
02 13 Gee, tough crowd. [to herself] Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!
02 13 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
02 13 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
02 13 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
02 13 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
02 13 
02 13 There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!
02 13 Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie dokie! Eat up! Like this! Numnumnum, numnumnumnum! Ahh!
02 13 No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
02 13 Huh, huh? Uh hey guys, look at me!
02 13 
02 13 Achoo!
02 13 ...yeah. I think I can see where this is going. 
02 13 [water running]
02 13 Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!
02 13 Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!?
02 13 Ooh, look guys, bubbles!
02 13 [bubble pops]
02 13 Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry, look, look, uh floating things! Ooh, aaah, eeh!
02 13 Uh, Don't make me do it, guys! You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
02 13   [hoof on nose] Smells like somepony needs me to changie-wangie their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow! [tiptoeing noise] Easy... easy...
02 13 
02 13 
02 13 [fight sounds; >Pound Cake and >Pumpkin Cake giggling throughout]
02 13 Wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still I've almost-
02 13 Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
02 13 [bell rings]
02 13 Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
02 13 Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like, I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
02 13 [ba-dum tish]
02 13 Excuse me?
02 13 Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit, I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
02 13 Well, of all the- she thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!
02 13 Pound Cake.  This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
02 13 And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
02 13 [toy squeaks]
02 13 Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!
02 13  [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
02 13 [toy squeaks]
02 13 Now that's what I call handling things. 
02 13 Oh, nononono. Not good not good not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out come out wherever you are!
02 13 [toy squeaks]
02 13 Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
02 13 Pound Cake?  Here, Pound Cake!
02 13 [wind blowing]
02 13 Uh, Pound Cake? Uh...
02 13  You can fly?!
02 13 Oh- get down here- this instant- young- colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
02 13 [plunger noises]
02 13 [magic noises]
02 13 No no no, Pumpkin.
02 13 No no.
02 13 No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no.
02 13 That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
02 13 
02 13 Gotcha! I think? [lots of Whoa!s, ows, etc]
02 13 [banging on stairs]
02 13 
02 13 Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
02 13 [banging on stairs]
02 13 [elastic stretching]
02 13 Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?
02 13 
02 13 
02 13  Y'know, you're right. That is funny.
02 13 Dear Princess Celestia, I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
02 13 [bell rings]
02 13 Shhh!
02 13  Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
02 13 [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.
02 13 
02 14 Speech! Speech!
02 14 Alright then, no speech!
02 14 And have fun. And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy and taffy gives lots of nervous energy! 
02 14 And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass.
02 14 Surprise!
02 14 Sorry! I was just practicing my “surprise!” for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champion of Equestria! Surprise!
02 14 Don't worry, Twilight. Got my lips all limbered up! [makes various noises with her mouth]
02 14 [door opens]
02 14 Surprise! Aw, shoot!
02 14 [panicked sounds under]
02 14 I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
02 14 Pickles!  Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!
02 14 [toilet flushes]
02 14 Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
02 14 I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back.
02 14 [door shuts]
02 14 Do you have any snacks?
02 14 That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!
02 14 What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!
02 14 Hey Applejack. Need some help?
02 14 I promise.
02 14 
02 14 Have you ever had a cherry changa? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question.
02 14 Well no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherry changa is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a Chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or Chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel. Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, Chimicherrychanga!
02 14 [continues chant, muffled by Rainbow Dash]
02 14 Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... [continues under]
02 14 Do you Pinkie promise?
02 14 Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.
02 14 
02 14 Good morning, Applejack. You ready for br- 
02 14 [sound of kettle boiling]
02 14 Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
02 14 Applejack! [slightly distorted] You Pinkie promised!
02 14 Applejack, come back here!
02 14 She's gonna get away!
02 14 Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!
02 14 
02 14 Get them! Get them!
02 14 Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!
02 14 Wha?
02 14 Well, I... I...
02 14 Well I heard a sorry in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me.
02 14 What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry, or Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? [continues under]
02 14 [continues repeating question to fadeout]
02 14 
02 15 
02 15 Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too and now it's just a big old cider party! Woohoo! Oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any.
02 15 She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!
02 15 I'll never forget the cider I just drank! It was a moment in time that will never exist again...
02 15 Non-pa what?
02 15 Yes sir, ma'am, sir!
02 15 Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!
02 15 
02 16 Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean-
02 16 Ooh yeah that's a good word. She's dazzling!
02 16 
02 16 Ayiyiyiyi!
02 16 
02 16 Ohh.
02 16 So much for dazzling.
02 16 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 16 [heart monitor beeping]
02 16  Is her face gonna stay that way?
02 16 Ooh, just like a spider! [to the doctor] Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
02 16 And look! You have a roommate!
02 16 [wheels squeaking]
02 16 Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really...
02 16 Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh...
02 16 [door closes]
02 16 Hey, nopony invited me!
02 16 
02 16 Oh, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
02 16 Fracas!
02 18 Let's do this. [wibbles tongue] Happy! Sad. Happy! Sad. Happy! Sad. Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut, open, shut. Yep, yep yep yep yep yep yep. Nope, nope nope nope nope nope nope. Oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooweooweoo! [blows raspberry, then pants]
02 18 [pinch noise]
02 18 Nailed it!
02 18 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 18 [rooster crows]
02 18 Morning, Daisy Jo! You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?
02 18 Well Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal.
02 18 Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year! I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again.
02 18 Absolutely!  Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!
02 18 Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.
02 18 Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!
02 18 And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you... in one hundred and thirty two days!

02 18 I would love to see you beam (Rock on!)
02 18 The corners of your mouth turned up
02 18 Is always Pinkie's dream (Hoof-bump!)
02 18 But if you're kind of worried
02 18 And your face has made a frown
02 18 I'll work real hard and do my best
02 18 To turn that sad frown upside down
02 18 'Cause I love to make you grin, grin, grin
02 18 Yes I do
02 18 Bust it out from ear to ear, let it begin
02 18 Just give me a joyful grin, grin, grin
02 18 And you fill me with good cheer
02 18 It's true, some days are dark and lonely
02 18 And maybe you feel sad
02 18 But Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
02 18 There's one thing that makes me happy
02 18 And makes my whole life worthwhile
02 18 And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile
02 18 I really am so happy
02 18 Your smile fills me with glee

02 18 Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile!
02 18 Come on and smile
02 18 Come on and smile!
02 18 I've never seen you before.
02 18 Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? “Property of C.D.D.” I'm guessing that last “D” is for Donkey.
02 18 Now, how 'bout that C. Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cleetus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher?-
02 18 And your middle name?
02 18 I'm sorry?
02 18 One more time...!
02 18  So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
02 18 You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy.
02 18 A Cranky Doodle Donkey.
02 18 I never met you but you're my new friend and I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!
02 18 C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!
02 18 ...what just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'. Check!
02 18 Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?
02 18 Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do.
02 18 Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
02 18 But I don't need to go, when I can stay and make friends... with you.
02 18 Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do.
02 18 Ooh, what does this bauble do?
02 18 Ooooooh, what's this?
02 18 Oooh, look at these!
02 18 [windchimes chime]
02 18 Eeeheeeheee!
02 18 Okay, Cranky.   I promised not to touch your wagon so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks!
02 18 Maybe we can be wagon buddies? Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it...
02 18 That's the spirit!
02 18 Welcome welcome welcome
02 18 A fine welcome to you
02 18 Welcome welcome welcome
02 18 I say how do you do?
02 18 Welcome welcome welcome
02 18 I say hip hip hurray
02 18 Welcome welcome welcome
02 18 To Ponyville today
02 18 Wait for it!
02 18 (timer dings, oven door opens, confetti flies out, and party kazoos have blowned away Cranky Doodle Donkey's hat and hair)
02 18 Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again!   Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile.
02 18 Where is what?  Spider! Big hairy spider!
02 18 Oh. Was that your wig?
02 18 I can fix this, I can fix this! [through megaphone] Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?
02 18 [through megaphone] This donkey is really, really, bald!
02 18 [through megaphone] What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!
02 18 Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you...
02 18 Please! Oh, please please please... [fades out]
02 18 Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT.
02 18 Hi, Cranky, I have a gift for you!
02 18 It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the “dreamboat special”.
02 18 He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm.
02 18 Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
02 18 Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
02 18 Well, why didn't you say so?
02 18 This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
02 18 Really? What were you doin' there?
02 18 Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?
02 18 Like me?
02 18 [to herself] Yes. I'm in. [to Cranky] Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?
02 18 It's awfully pretty.
02 18 Huh?
02 18 I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about-
02 18 
02 18 
02 18 Oh no!
02 18 There! Uh, all better?
02 18 I'm sorry, Cranky!
02 18 ...It is?
02 18 Never, or never-ever?
02 18 That's four 'ever's. That's like... forever!
02 18 I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
02 18 No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!
02 18 Cranky!
02 18 Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
02 18 So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
02 18 But do you accept my apology?
02 18 Oh Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!
02 18 But I'm really, really, really...
02 18 ...really, really-
02 18 [engines revving]
02 18 ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really really really... [continues saying “really”, speed increases until] ...sorry!
02 18 [sound of locks and chains]
02 18 [six knocks]
02 18 Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you!
02 18 Her? Her who? The special friend?
02 18  Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
02 18 You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
02 18 Well when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday, nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
02 18 And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things.
02 18 And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
02 18 Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle...
02 18 So does this mean that you accept my apology?
02 18 [explodes like a firework] Woohoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together, and chat, and sing songs, and  party! Oh, I can throw you guys a big party! It'll be called a 'Welcome to Ponyville, I found my lost love, I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie Party'! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
02 18 Oh. Um, but we're still friends?
02 18 Great!
02 18 Dear Princess Celestia, there are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
02 18 He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart
02 18 She's his cranky doodle joy
02 18 I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah!
02 18 I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
02 18 Whoops, privacy. Sorry.
02 18 [Yankee Doodle Dandy plays over credits]
02 19 It's bigger than big, it's double big, you are a pony with a problem.
02 19 Right there! That's the problem.
02 19 What do you think you're doing?
02 19 Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous, one bit is the right price.
02 19 One bit.
02 19 One bit!
02 19 One bit!
02 19 Two bits!
02 19 Two bits!
02 19 I insist it's two bits or nothing!
02 19 Have it your way, one bit it is!
02 19 
02 19 See? Asserting yourself can be fun!
02 19 Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
02 19 Who's next, please, and what can I get for you today?
02 19 Heyyy, look at you!
02 19 Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
02 19 Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some? 
02 19 Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
02 19 New Fluttershy... old Fluttershy...!?
02 19 Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershies to keep track of! Make it stop!
02 19 Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!
02 19 [starts crying] Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
02 19 
02 19 It's Pinkie Pie, and Rarity!
02 19 We did?
02 19 Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
02 19 No, but he is.
02 19 Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
02 19 We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures, uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
02 19 But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.
02 19 A full day!
02 19 Full day!
02 19 Half day!
02 19 We need half a day and no more!
02 19 Okie dokie. See you tomorrow.
02 19 But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!
02 19 
02 19 
02 19 
02 19 [goat munching]
02 19 
02 19 You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!
02 19 The one we missed!
02 19 Friends.
02 19 
02 20 C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!
02 20 Run for your liiiiiiiife!
02 20  Anypony else wanna panic with me? No? [resumes screaming]
02 20 Okay everypony, follow my lead. 
02 20 
02 20 [stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?
02 20 I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
02 20  Come... enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny...  Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?
02 20  Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year...
02 20 That's it.
02 20 Yep. Cool birthday present.
02 20 Oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events.
02 20 
02 20 Like that, see? Where did that even come from?
02 20 Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh...
02 20 [papers rustling]
02 20 Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
02 20 [to Twilight] Are... you okay?
02 20 Sure!
02 20 Nice!
02 20 Makes sense to me!
02 20 Three hours? But when did you sleep?
02 20 Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!
02 20 I have no idea!
02 20 Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
02 20 Aren't we wearing them for fun?
02 20 Oh... Are you sure?
02 20 Awesome! That sounds fun!
02 20 Aww.
02 20 
02 20 [ripping sound]
02 20 I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
02 20 Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
02 20 Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
02 20 [orchestral twang]
02 20 [angelic choir]
02 20 Twilight, the guard!
02 20 Oh!
02 20 And that's bad, right?
02 20 Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?
02 20 Woohoo!
02 20 Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
02 20 Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now.
02 20 
02 21 Me neither neither.
02 21  Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!
02 21  And 'super-duper scary'!
02 21 
02 21 Oh, not even close!
02 23 Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. “Mayor, not naturally gray!” The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?
02 23 What?!  It's true! I do have a problem!
02 24 Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
02 24 Absolutely! It's my honor and I-
02 24 Alrighty then Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying.
02 24 Don't worry Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see!
02 24 Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance , better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right everypony, we're in the home stretch here. See Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?
02 24 [<a href="/wiki/Theme_song" title="Theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
02 24 
02 24 
02 24  Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
02 24 Well the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the "MMMM".
02 24 Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
02 24 Hello. What's your name?
02 24 The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
02 24 Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect "MMMM."
02 24 Mmm hmmm. I know for super sure that "MMMM" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too.
02 24 So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
02 24 But they are! I just know it.
02 24 I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
02 24 Huh? Stop you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh? Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what.
02 24 [blinds snap shut]
02 24 Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!
02 24 
02 24 Stop thief!
02 24 
02 24 Oh, are you okay thief?  Huh... overreacting my hoof. I knew I was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what I'm gonna do. 
02 24 [rooster crow]
02 24  Huh? What?  The cake! Oh MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous.
02 24 I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
02 24 Look at what? Huh? 
02 24 
02 24 It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been  mutilated.
02 24 
02 24 Now we just need to find out who done it.
02 24 Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
02 24 Exactly.
02 24 
02 24 And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
02 24 Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
02 24 Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is...
02 24 No! 'Cause I know who did it.
02 24 
02 24 How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your éclairs lacked flair, Gustave!
02 24 [silent film music]
02 24 Thus, destroying the cake, and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.
02 24 What do you mean, lowly assistant?
02 24 Huh... guess that isn't a totally silly question.
02 24 Hm... you're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "MMMM" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!
02 24 [spy music]
02 24 Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.
02 24 
02 24 
02 24 [spraying noise]
02 24 [laser noise]
02 24 Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
02 24 Huh... you may be right, lowly assistant.
02 24 Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
02 24 Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".
02 24 Mulia Mild!
02 24 [ninja sounds]
02 24 
02 24 [cutting sounds]
02 24 Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself Mulia.
02 24  I guess you're right...
02 24 But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "MMMM". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. Hoh, why this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
02 24 [munching sounds]
02 24 
02 24  Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
02 24 This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
02 24 Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?
02 24 I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
02 24 And then, I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there he was gone.
02 24 Already?
02 24 I heard somepony else in the dessert car, and chased them up to the engine. But, when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
02 24 Well... I went back to the dessert car.
02 24 The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
02 24 I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud, and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
02 24 That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
02 24 Exactly.
02 24 A-ha! A blue feather. I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand.
02 24 No, 'cause he's been dying them!
02 24 So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
02 24 So it was you, that pink hair came from your rainbow colored mane!
02 24 So you're wearing a wig?
02 24 [stretching noises]
02 24 You're goin' down, Fluttershy.
02 24 That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
02 24 You're right Twilight. You know what we have to do?
02 24 Look for clues! Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
02 24 I most certainly did. It was, none other than, the bakers!
02 24 
02 24 First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache, and Joe has éclair in his hair, and Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
02 24 I think we can fix that. Come on!
02 24 Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts.
02 24 How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?
02 24 I don't mind if I do.
02 24 [munching sounds]
02 24 Mmmmm.
02 24 
02 24 
02 25 Hip, hip, hooray!
02 25   Best wedding ever!
02 25 We're here, we're here!
02 25 Aaaaaaaaa- [sneezes like a trumpet]
02 25 Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...
02 25 [polka from Swarm of the Century plays]
02 25 I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
02 25  Thank you!
02 25 [kissing noises and laughing]
02 26 Rarity!
02 26  Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better.
02 26 [fly flying sounds]
02 26 Let's get this party started!
03 01 Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
03 01 Time to gather some intel!
03 01 Because it isn't!
03 01 Aaaah!
03 01 A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y! 
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 There was a crystal flugelhorn
03 01 That everypony liked to play
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
03 01 It's gonna be fun!
