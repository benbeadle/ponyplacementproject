01 01 No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.
01 01 Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo- [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!
01 01 Out of my hair? What about your hair?!
01 01 No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.
01 01 Huh?
01 01 [crash]
01 01 Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamor, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!
01 01 Huh?
01 01 [ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]
01 01 She's gone!
01 01 [ponies gasping]
01 02 She's gone.
01 02 Ugh, Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful.
01 02 Take that, you ruffian!
01 02 My hair! Woop--
01 02 Eugh. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally.
01 02 I didn't see you there, my apologies.
01 02 She is.
01 02 Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
01 02 And your expertly coiffed mane.
01 02 Your fabulous manicure.
01 02 All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
01 02 I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
01 02 You look smashing.
01 02 Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.
01 02 Look!
01 02 Oh, thank goodness.
01 02 I know! I'll never part with it again.
01 02 What? Ooh. So does yours.
01 03 [gasp] Are these what I think they are?
01 03 The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamor! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.
01 03 Him. I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, "Who is that mysterious mare?" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say,"Yes!" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is [giggles] what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.
01 03 Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph.
01 03 You haven't?
01 03 You? You want to go to the gala?
01 03 But Twilight-
01 03 Twilight, it's raining.
01 03 Come with me before you catch a cold.
01 03 Oh no, it's quite alright. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?
01 03 Makeovers!
01 03 There. Oh, you're simply darling.
01 03 And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
01 03 Now you just need a hat.
01 03 [laughs] Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at The Grand Galloping Gala.
01 03 [gasp] And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn. Ah, [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course.
01 03 Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.
01 03 Allow us to treat you to dinner.
01 04 But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
01 04 [moan]
01 04 Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
01 04 Messy? Well, did you see her mane?
01 05 Ooo. [sneezes]
01 05 I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.
01 05 Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?
01 06 My, my, my! What boasting!
01 06 Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
01 06 [raspberry] Just who does she think she is?
01 06 Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
01 06 Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.
01 06 A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
01 06 Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
01 06 Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair! [cries] Such an awful, awful color! [cries]
01 06 Hate you?
01 06 Why, whatever do you mean, darling?
01 06 Most unpleasant.
01 06 Mm-hmm.
01 07 Huh?
01 07 Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?
01 07 Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
01 07 [affirmations]
01 07 Ewww! Much better. Onward!
01 07 Good thing I brought my scarf.
01 07 I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!
01 07 Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
01 07 Almost there.
01 07 Eugh. Bu-la-la-la-la.
01 07 Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.
01 07 [cry]
01 07 My apologies.
01 07 [coughs] Obviously, this situation just calls for a little "pony charm". Allow me, girls. I'm so sorry to interrupt. [clears throat] But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?
01 07 Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
01 07 [cry]
01 07 I was this close to getting that diamond.
01 07 Oh, yeah... sure.
01 07 [horn]
01 07 Darling, you look ridiculous.
01 08 Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
01 08 Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.
01 08 I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
01 08 Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
01 08 Oh! Ah! Oh Ph!! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
01 08 [pant] Oh, no, no, no!
01 08 I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
01 08 [scoff] Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
01 08 [laugh] That doesn't even make any sense.
01 08 Does not.
01 08 Does not.
01 08 Does not.
01 08 Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
01 08 On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
01 08 Nor am I.
01 08 After you!
01 08 [thunder cracks]
01 08 [>Applejack and >Rarity yelp]
01 08 Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
01 08 Oh! Unacceptable.
01 08 Twilight?
01 08 Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
01 08 Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
01 08 It may indeed be a problem.
01 08 Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack.
01 08 Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.
01 08 Yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]
01 08 Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
01 08 [sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
01 08 Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
01 08 So do we have an agreement?
01 08 Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
01 08 Fortunately, I can get along with any pony, no matter how difficult she may be.
01 08 <span class="anchor" style="display: none;" id="notaword">notaword</span>>Applejack
01 08 Oh yeah? Well, I'm the get-alongin'ist pony yer ever gonna meet.
01 08 That's not even a word.
01 08 Yay.
01 08 So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?
01 08 Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated every pony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!
01 08 It is a ghost story, they're all made up.
01 08 [screams]
01 08 [gasp] [scream]
01 08 Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered -- that's critical -- and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da! [laugh]
01 08 [sigh] You could at least say excuse me.
01 08 I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
01 08 I think the truth of the matter is that some pony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
01 08 [gasps]!
01 08 Fine! [cries]
01 08 Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a fru-fru, glittery, lacey outfit.
01 08 Very. [smirk]
01 08 I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
01 08 And I dare you to comb yours just once.
01 08 Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. Oh! It! Is! On! [grunt]
01 08 [gasp] She started it.
01 08 Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
01 08 They were. There might still be a little on them.
01 08 Eww!
01 08 I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
01 08 Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
01 08 Hey!
01 08 You did that on purpose.
01 08 Get up so I can fix it again.
01 08 M-mmm!
01 08 You will if you want any blankets.
01 08 I will not!
01 08 Won't!
01 08 Won't!
01 08 Won't!
01 08 No, it is I who have been trying my best.
01 08 No, it was I.
01 08 I!
01 08 [gasp]
01 08 But I--
01 08 Wait! Stop! Don't!
01 08 [cry]
01 08 [cries] I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
01 08 Cleaning up this mess some pony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you.
01 08 What was that?
01 08 Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky.
01 08 Oh. Let's do this.
01 08 [grunt]
01 08 U-ugh. Oh, I look awful.
01 08 Hmph, thanks.
01 08 [laughter]
01 08 Is it smaller than a saddle?
01 08 Are we getting warmer?
01 08 Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
01 08 It is?
01 08 [laughter]
01 08 Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
01 08 Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.
01 08 Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
01 08 Are too.
01 08 Are too.
01 08 Are too.
01 08 [laughter]
01 08 [cheers]
01 08 [laughter]
01 08 Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.
01 08 [laughter] Sorry.
01 08 [laughter]
01 08 [music]
01 08 [credits]
01 09 Just look at those stripes! So garish!
01 09 [faints]
01 09 [faints]
01 09 Then, she lurks by the stores.
01 09 She went outside!
01 09 Wicked, wicked zebra!
01 09 I'm afraid I have to agree. [Blows hair out of her face]
01 09 [Spike and Twilight yell in surprise]
01 09 Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
01 09 And I as well.
01 09 Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
01 09 Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?
01 09 Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!
01 09 Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
01 09 Oh. I look horrible!
01 09 Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!
01 09 [Ponies gasp]
01 09 She stole your song?
01 09 You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
01 09 You made me look ridiculous.
01 09 And the creepy decor?
01 09 Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
01 09 Ooh. I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
01 10 Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
01 10 Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
01 10 [flattered laughter] Thank you Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
01 10 Huh?
01 10 Me too, oh, they're perfect.
01 10 Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
01 10 Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross. No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique.
01 10 [screech]
01 10 Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
01 10 Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
01 10 [gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
01 10 Ew! If you ask me it's already a total disaster.
01 10 [shriek]
01 10 Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
01 10 My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks]
01 10 [shriek]
01 11 And even though I love my boots
01 11 This fashion's getting old
01 11 Little critters hibernate
01 11 Under the snow and ice
01 11 We help them gather up their food
01 11 Fix their homes below
01 11 So their families can grow!
01 11 Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
01 11 Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
01 11 Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
01 11 Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.
01 11 Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...
01 11 Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this, [mumbling]
01 11 Ah, and we need to weave the string...
01 11 [sob]
01 14 Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping up in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
01 14 Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.
01 14 Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.
01 14 What's that? You want to help me more! Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
01 14 Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.
01 14 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 14 Is there something I can help you with?
01 14 Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!
01 14 Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
01 14 Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
01 14 Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.
01 14 You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.
01 14 What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
01 14 Deal!
01 14 Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.
01 14 I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
01 14 Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!
01 14 Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
01 14 Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
01 14 [>Rarity]
01 14 Thread by thread, stitching it together
01 14 Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip
01 14 Making sure the fabric folds nicely
01 14 It's the perfect color and so hip
01 14 Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
01 14 Making sure the clothes' correctly facing
01 14 I'm stitching Twilight's dress
01 14 Yard by yard, fussing on the details
01 14 Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
01 14 Make her something perfect to inspire
01 14 Even though she hates formal attire
01 14 Gotta mind those intimate details
01 14 Even though she's more concerned with sales
01 14 It's Applejack's new dress
01 14 Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink
01 14 Fluttershy something breezy
01 14 Blend color and form,
01 14 [To Opalescence] Do you think it looks cheesy?
01 14 Something brash, perhaps quite fetching
01 14 Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die?
01 14 Making sure it fits forelock and crest
01 14 Don't forget some magic in the dress
01 14 Even though it rides high on the flank
01 14 Rainbow won't look like a tank
01 14 I'm stitching Rainbow's dress
01 14 Piece by piece, snip by snip
01 14 Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
01 14 Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
01 14 Yard by yard, never stressed
01 14 And that's the art of the dress!
01 14 That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now! These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out BEAUTIFUL, don't you think? Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?
01 14 But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
01 14 That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them.
01 14 I want them to be better that just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
01 14 Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.
01 14 What have I gotten myself into?
01 14 Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?
01 14 Oh, you're just saying that.
01 14 "Nice"?
01 14 If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
01 14 Like it or love it?
01 14 Which is it?
01 14 Well, just tell me what you really think.
01 14 Tell me.
01 14 Tell me!
01 14 Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!
01 14 Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
01 14 Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
01 14 Even if my fabric choice was perfect
01 14 Gotta get them all done by tonight
01 14 Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive
01 14 Wait until you see it in the light
01 14 I'm sewing them together!
01 14 Well, I think...
01 14 Well...
01 14 Hour by hour, one more change
01 14 I'm sewing them together, take great pains
01 14 Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
01 14 Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
01 14 Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
01 14 Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine
01 14 Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call
01 14 Brings a whole new revision
01 14 Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision
01 14 Ugh...
01 14 Streamers?
01 14 Streamers it is.
01 14 Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
01 14 Do you not like the color?
01 14 Do you not like the shape?
01 14 Got to overcome intimidation
01 14 Remember, it's all in the presentation!
01 14 Piece by piece, snip by snip
01 14 Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
01 14 Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
01 14 Yard by yard, always stressed
01 14 And that's the art of the dress!
01 14 Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
01 14 Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
01 14 Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.
01 14 Hoity-Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?
01 14 Oh. [gasp] There he is! [deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. UUUAAA, what's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.
01 14 I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock! [sobs]
01 14 Leave me alone! I want to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'M SO PATHETIC!
01 14 Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?
01 14 Huh? Opal?
01 14 Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!
01 14 Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
01 14 What is it? It's not... You... [gasp]
01 14 Like it? Like it?!
01 14 No, I don't like it.
01 14 I LOVE IT!
01 14 You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
01 14 Oh, I forgive you.
01 14 But my whole career is still ruined!
01 14 Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!
01 14 [gasp]
01 16 Go on, go on.
01 16 Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
01 16 Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!
01 16 You've got to try!
01 16 I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
01 16 I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
01 16 Yes!
01 16 [in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!
01 16 Oh, wait for me!
01 16 Why, thank you!
01 16 Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
01 16 [gasp] Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.
01 16 [snowflake workers grumbling and yelling]
01 16 Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that.
01 16 Oh, they were just admiring my wings Rainbow Dash.
01 16 Why, these old things? Go ahead everypony. Photos are encouraged.
01 16 Oh pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?
01 16 Waa-haa-haa!
01 16 There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
01 16 I'm going to be awhile!
01 16 I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
01 16 Rarity... Is ready!
01 16 Well Rainbow Dash? Shall we?
01 16 Good luck Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.
01 16 And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] They'll be talking about it for years!
01 16 [panting] Look upon me Equestria, for I Am Rarity!
01 16 [crowd oohs]
01 16 Uh-oh. [screams]
01 16 [Screams some more]
01 16 [more screaming]
01 16 [gasp]
01 16 [sigh] You sure did. Oh thank you Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!
01 16 I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
01 16 And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
01 16 Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
01 16 I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
01 17 Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already... [clatter] Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to-- oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?
01 17 No!
01 17 No thanks!
01 17 Just stand over there.
01 17 Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!
01 17 [gasps]
01 17 [clattering noises]
01 17 Aah!
01 17 [crashing noises]
01 17 [sigh]
01 17 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 17 No. You've helped me quite enough.
01 17 I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
01 17 Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
01 17 [doorbell rings]
01 17 Oh, what now?!
01 17 [gasps] Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
01 17 Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
01 17 Ahh! Did you use... The Stare on her?
01 17 Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
01 17 I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
01 17 No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.
01 17 [twinkling]
01 17 See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
01 17 Well, I, uh...
01 17 I'll manage.
01 17 Hello, uh, girls ...
01 17 Sweetie Belle! What have you DONE? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
01 17 I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
01 17 No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle; it's just the way it has to be.
01 17 I couldn't ask you to do that.
01 17 Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
01 17 I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
01 17 I assure you, they're quite a handful.
01 17 Well... all right.
01 17 Hmmm...
01 17 [clattering hooves]
01 17 [sigh] Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again.
01 17 I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
01 17 Girls! Time to-- Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to-- GIRLS!
01 17 Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?
01 17 Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.
01 17 How about now? [strains]
01 17 [Opal yowls]
01 18 Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
01 19 Perfect!
01 19 [doorbell ringing]
01 19 Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique and magnifique. [gasp] Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop!
01 19 You yah... Y-y-you know my name?
01 19 Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?
01 19 [giggle] How may I help you, Sapphire?
01 19 I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pièce de résistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.
01 19 Really?
01 19 Beg pardon?
01 19 [faints]
01 19 Spike, a lady is never jealous.
01 19 Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. O, aha!
01 19 Yes, Spike! Right there!
01 19 Spike! I promised I'll give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
01 19 Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.
01 19 Spike!
01 19 You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you'll get the finest reward. This is from me to you.
01 19 Is something wrong, Spike?
01 19 Oh, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.
01 19 Spike! Where are you?
01 19 You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
01 19 I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak.[laugh]
01 19 Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo... Ewww! Uh... uh... Good day, gentle... uh, fellow. I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
01 19 And you are...
01 19 Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I know diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] are you out hunting for gems as well?
01 19 Uh... we?
01 19 Spike! Come on! Hurry!
01 19 Waah! Spike!
01 19 Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you scum! You rough-!
01 19 Spike! Ah, dirt! Aaaaah, Aaaaah!
01 19 Save me...!
01 19 Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!
01 19 Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.
01 19 But what ever do you want from me?
01 19 Oh! Is that all?
01 19 There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?
01 19 What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
01 19 Dig?
01 19 Ohh...
01 19 Forgive me but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.
01 19 I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
01 19 Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with that jagged things.
01 19 Good heavens, what is that smell?
01 19 Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.
01 19 Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated. You look and smell like if you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Water, water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?
01 19 And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity".
01 19 Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!
01 19 But I thought you wanted whiiining!
01 19 [dreamily] Anything?
01 19 Oh, this water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.
01 19 What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! [whining] Not sooo tiiight!
01 19 Did you just call me a... mule?
01 19 Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly? [cries]
01 19 He called me ugly!
01 19 An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
01 19 You're just saying that!
01 19 I don't believe you! You never liked me! [wails]
01 19 Why, yes. Hello, girls. You are just in time to assist me.
01 19 With those.
01 19 Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
01 19 Me? What did I teach you?
01 19 Not if you eat them all, Spike.
01 19 [laughter]
01 19 [credits]
01 20 So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. [to the spa ponies] The usual!
01 20 But you will not believe what happened to me.
01 20 Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street? But Photo Finish!
01 20 She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anyhow, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
01 20 She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
01 20 Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
01 20 But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you!
01 20 Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me.
01 20 Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
01 20 Nopony!
01 20 Please!
01 20 Please!
01 20 Please, please, PLEEEASE!
01 20 Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
01 20 Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution!
01 20 [cut to the spa]
01 20 The usual!
01 20 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 20 Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
01 20 More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress need more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins! And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon. Oh, this hem is completely off. PINCUSHION! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous.
01 20 Let me just say, what an honor!
01 20 Attitude and pizzazz!
01 20 Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.
01 20 Really?
01 20 Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria".
01 20 Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.
01 20 No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!
01 20 Never.
01 20 That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.
01 20 But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?
01 20 Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! YOU MUST!
01 20 It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.
01 20 I just vant to be alone right now.
01 20 Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
01 20 Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing" at the place.
01 20 I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
01 20 [door bell]
01 20 Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
01 20 Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs.
01 20 Rarity, of course.
01 20 My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
01 20 Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
01 20 I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!
01 20 Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.
01 20 Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
01 20 [hilarity in the process of ensuing]
01 20 Oh no.
01 20 Bravo! I say bravo!
01 20 Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
01 20 Fluttershy! Are you all right?
01 20 Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.
01 20 I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
01 20 You do?
01 20 Then why did you keep doing it?
01 20 And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
01 20 All this time!
01 20 I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
01 20 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
01 20 We go!
01 20 Isn't it, though?
01 21 Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
01 21 No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
01 21 Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
01 21 It's widdle Rarity who's all 'saddy-waddy'! Urgh!
01 21 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 21 [indistinct conversations: >Rainbow Dash
01 21 Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting I can't even wait!
01 21 [sigh] For crying out loud in the morning!
01 21 [more indistinct conversations: >Fluttershy(?)
01 21 I can't wait! >Rainbow Dash
01 21 Yeah, yeah!]
01 21 Would you all be QUIET... NOOOOW!!!???
01 21 I just love their accessories!
01 21 I want to speak to the manager!
01 21 They took Spike!
01 21 Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!
01 21 About the trees. Now if you could –
01 22 Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!
01 22 Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!
01 22 Put me down!
01 23 Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
01 23 Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.[Rarity's flashback begins where there is a practice for a school play going on, a group of fillies, a younger version of Cheerilee, the future teacher of Apple Bloom's class, are in costumes for the play: a group of fruit, a dandellion, a cake, a stack of hay, and a flower. The camera pans from group to the filly version of Rarity, and her teacher, who are watching the play practice from behind the scenes.]
01 23 I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night.
01 23 I had no idea where my horn was taking me.
01 23 But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason.
01 23 I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark!
01 23 I knew that this was... MY DESTINY!
01 23 Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
01 23 There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
01 23 We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
01 24 Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
01 24 Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
01 24 Ooh, poor little thing.
01 24 And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
01 24 [Spike rages]
01 24 Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
01 25 This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your “Spring Has Sprung” party?
01 25 Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirée.
01 25 [sniff] [whimper] Hmm… perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that’s been wrapped in moldy hay, and dipped in dragon perspiration.
01 25 Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What’s the occasion?
01 25 The party is this afternoon? As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
01 25 Oh… do they?
01 25 And I’m sure that we would, but I’m going to have to decline. I have to… wash my hair!
01 25 It doesn’t?
01 25 See? [belch] Dirty! I have to go!
01 25 She didn’t see you at the sweet shop, did she?
01 25 Oh, good. I’d hate for her to ruin everything.
01 25 Have you seen her?
01 25 Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
01 25 Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
01 25 [whispering] See you later!
01 25 We’ve been planning this party for such a long time. We had to make excuses for why we couldn’t attend Gummy’s party, so that we could get everything ready for yours.
01 25 That’s what we’ve been trying to tell you, darling.
01 25 Aww, he was upset?
01 26 Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
01 26 Where are the others? It's getting late.
01 26 What ever shall we do?
01 26 Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?
01 26 Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
01 26 [moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
01 26 We'll just have to see.
01 26 At the Gala, all the royals
01 26 They will meet fair Rarity
01 26 They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala! (at the Gala)
01 26 I will find him, my Prince Charming,
01 26 And how gallant he will be,
01 26 He will treat me like a lady, tonight at the Gala!
01 26 [>Choir]
01 26 This is what we've waited for, to have the best night ever!
01 26 Each of us will live our dreams, tonight at the Gala, at the Gala!
01 26 Find my prince
01 26 To find!
01 26 [gasp] [sounds of excitement] Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... WAIT! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined.
01 26 I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
01 26 [moan]
01 26 This isn't at all what I imagined.
01 26 I waited all my life...
01 26 Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
01 26 Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
01 26 Yes. "One" certainly would.
01 26 Oh, of course it will.
01 26 Two apple fritters, please.
01 26 Ahem.
01 26 Ahem!
01 26 [sigh] I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
01 26 Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.
01 26 [scream]
01 26 [angry growl] You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
01 26 Afraid to get dirty?!
01 26 [shriek] No! Ugh! Let's go!
01 26 ...being together here has made it all better.
02 01 Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella.
02 01 Spike, Twilight will come up with something.
02 01 Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
02 01 I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
02 01 Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
02 01 See you in the center.
02 01 I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sports. Agh. Oh my...
02 01 Yes, I like very much. No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine! Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home. [grunts]
02 01 [wall crash]
02 01 What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! [grunts]
02 01 Little help here! Thanks, Twilight.
02 01 But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
02 01 [thunder crash]
02 02 HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!
02 02 Don't touch my gem!
02 02 [grunting]
02 02 Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!
02 02 Well, it's not going to work.
02 02 Mm-mm.
02 02 Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish.
02 02 Mine!
02 02 No, but if you want it, I want it!
02 02 [grunting]
02 02 MINE!
02 02 [offscreen] What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--!
02 02 Let us never speak of this again.
02 02 How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of cloud is Cloudsdale?
02 02 I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
02 02 WHOA!
02 02 PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
02 02 Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?
02 03 [loud scream]
02 03 [more loud screaming]
02 03 [sobbing] Why me-e-e-e-e-ee...[gasp] WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
02 03 [gasp] I've lost my diamond encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched HIGH, and I have searched LOW. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!
02 03 Oh there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?
02 03 Mmhm!
02 03 Yeah.
02 03 Hmm... there is one thing.
02 03 I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
02 03 Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight?
02 03 Please tell me I did not forget the plates. [gasp] I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! [cries] Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
02 03 [various shock statements]
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 [sighs of relief]
02 03 [giggles]
02 03 Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking...
02 03 Don't look at what?
02 03 Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!
02 03 As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
02 03 Mmhmm.
02 03 [All right, etc]
02 03 [cheering]
02 03 And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
02 03 [laughs]
02 05 [fades in] [mumbling in sleep] Oh... Are those sweet... carrot... pancakes I smell? [gasp] Mmm, how divine, num num num num. The aroma... spiced warm apple cider. [sniff] Ahh, and, the smell of... smoke... smoke? Smoke?! [screams]
02 05 [sighs]
02 05 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 05 [inhales]
02 05 Father! Mother!
02 05 I... figured. [sniffs] I didn't know you could burn juice.
02 05 Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant this week'?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?
02 05 So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?
02 05 But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
02 05 [crash]
02 05 Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
02 05 Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
02 05 Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going.
02 05 Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.
02 05 You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
02 05 Okay, now easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here...
02 05 Not... bad.
02 05 [gasps] There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
02 05 Sweetie Belle!
02 05 Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
02 05 The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool- shrinks...
02 05 Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create.
02 05 Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?
02 05 [in Sweetie Belle's mind] Stay out of trouble, okay?
02 05 [screams] Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
02 05 But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
02 05 [sighs] Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?
02 05 That's not what I meant!
02 05 Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
02 05 No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
02 05 Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle? [gasps in shock]
02 05 My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
02 05 This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you- and you put everything away!
02 05 But this was my mess, in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
02 05 Happy?! Happy?! I- I just need some time alone. Hm!
02 05 What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.
02 05 Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister.
02 05 Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
02 05 [gasps] Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
02 05 Deal!
02 05 Hmph!
02 05 Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [breathes in] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't- [clears throat] No matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!
02 05 Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favourite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle-
02 05 Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm.
02 05 Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project? Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone! [crying] Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!
02 05 [gasps] Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I-
02 05 Oh Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.
02 05 Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear-
02 05 What?!
02 05 But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I, I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favourite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?
02 05 Uh... yes?
02 05 Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
02 05 Of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
02 05 But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!
02 05 That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line.
02 05 Mm-hmm.
02 05 Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
02 05 Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!
02 05 The spa, of course.
02 05 No, I, I, I'm serious.
02 05 Very well then, what shall we write to the Princess?
02 05 I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
02 05 A little bit dirty.
02 05 A little bit dirty!
02 05 Deal!
02 05 [birds chirping]
02 05 [credits]
02 06 A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
02 07 Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
02 07 Say you're sorry, Opal.
02 07 She's... sorry.
02 07 Tortoise!
02 07 I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it! [sneezes]
02 08 Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
02 08 I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
02 09 [gasp] Here? I get to stay here?
02 09 Thank you so much, Princess.
02 09 No, really. This is so nice of you.
02 09 Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you, thank you, thank you! [more kisses]
02 09 Thank you!
02 09 Thank you!
02 09 That's perfect.
02 09 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 09 Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot? [sips] Ahh. Everything! I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart. [sips] Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence?
02 09 Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I-
02 09 Oh, yes, of course... how are you?
02 09 Well, yeah, yes, but-
02 09 [disappointed sigh]
02 09 ”Looked a little country”. ”Not something you can get in Canterlot”. I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!
02 09 [panting] I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party. [gasps] Fancypants?
02 09 Oh goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there, I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and--
02 09 Wh- The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
02 09 Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days. [pant] Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.
02 09 Me?
02 09 Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.
02 09 Rarity.
02 09 Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro: Fancypants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancypants! [excited giggling]
02 09 Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
02 09 I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
02 09 [ponies gasp]
02 09 [fanfare]
02 09 [whistle]
02 09 [cheers]
02 09 My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
02 09 Uh... [gulps] Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
02 09 ...and then I said, “Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"
02 09 [ponies laughing]
02 09 Oh, I'd love to, but I-
02 09 Well, that sounds wonderful, but I-
02 09 I'm flattered, really, it's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-
02 09 ...of course I'll be there.
02 09 [the three ponies uttering relief]
02 09 Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancypants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?
02 09 I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go
02 09 I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
02 09 I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow
02 09 I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
02 09 Becoming as popular as popular can be
02 09 Making my mark, making my mark in high society
02 09 I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah
02 09 I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
02 09 See how they hang on every word that I speak
02 09 My approving glance is what they all seek
02 09 I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe
02 09 I'm the type of pony everypony should know
02 09 At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht
02 09 Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot
02 09 I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe, yeah
02 09 I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
02 09 Because I'm the type of pony
02 09 Yes, I'm the type of pony
02 09 Yes, I'm the type of pony everypony should know
02 09 Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
02 09 We'd better get going.
02 09 I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensem-
02 09 [letterbox clicks]
02 09 For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon... Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust! [gasps] The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot! [squeals] Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony. [winces] It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.
02 09 No. But, I will need some help unpacking them.
02 09 What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!
02 09 [gasps]
02 09 What are you-- how did you-- Why are you--
02 09 What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
02 09 Wow... first you get me a suite at Canterlot castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight.
02 09 This? Uh- well I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up. [laughs nervously]
02 09 Oh, uhh, she's... hold on a minute.
02 09 [doors slam]
02 09 I am so sorry about this.
02 09 [running water]
02 09 She's resting on the bed.
02 09 Yes.
02 09 [sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
02 09 Fancypants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Haha.
02 09 Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance... I'm here!
02 09 I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
02 09 ...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
02 09 [sighs] Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me...
02 09 [chokes]
02 09 I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
02 09 I really should go check on Opal...
02 09 Is that Princess Celestia?
02 09 [hushed] I need to use the little fillies' room!
02 09 Can I get anypony more punch?
02 09 I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...? [trails off]
02 09 [muffled] What croquet mallet?
02 09 [laughs nervously] Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...
02 09 I, I...
02 09 Twilight let me explain! I-
02 09 You must understand! I-
02 09 Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason. [laughs nervously]
02 09 Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.
02 09 Nothing. See you girls later!
02 09 Oh no!
02 09 [explosion]
02 09 [many birds chirping]
02 09 [sips]
02 09 [nervous laugh] Yeah.
02 09 [spit-take]
02 09 Fancypants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing, that's over there. On the other side of the room.
02 09 That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old-
02 09 Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.
02 09 With pleasure!
02 09 Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.
02 09 I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
02 10 [muffled] Hellooo? [normal] Anypony home? Twilight? [gasps] Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets...
02 10 Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?
02 10 Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game... [bites] I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
02 10 Like it? It's magnificent.
02 10 I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey! [kisses] Thank you so much!
02 10 Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!
02 10 I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm.
02 10 [hums] Perhaps some more ruffle. [screams]
02 10 [siren]
02 10 [ponies screaming]
02 10 [screams]
02 10 Put me down, you brute!
02 10 How rude.
02 10 Hey! I'm- Not some- -sort of common- fly swatter!
02 10 Girls! My cape!
02 10 [screams]
02 10 Oh be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
02 10 Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?
02 10 [screaming]
02 10 Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.
02 10 Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey! [kisses]
02 11 Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!
02 11 Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
02 11 Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve, in their own towns. It's tradition.
02 11 Well no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
02 11 Hundreds.
02 11 [gasps] Maybe even thousands!
02 11 Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
02 11 My hair!
02 11 [arguing]
02 11 [gasps] How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!
02 11 Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!
02 11 I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!
02 11 [arguing]
02 11 [shivering] Clover the Clever! I need you!
02 11 Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble, and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!
02 11 We must find a new land!
02 11 Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?
02 11 Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?
02 11 Stoooooop!
02 11 That is what's wrong!
02 11 [water rushing]
02 11 I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.
02 11 And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library.
02 11 I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled! [squeals] In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!
02 11 We found our new home!
02 11 Did not!
02 11 All of you riff-raff are trespassing in Unicornia!
02 11 Unicornia!
02 11 That's barbaric. Clover the Clever? Throw that brute into the dungeon!
02 11 [laughs]
02 11 [whack]
02 11 Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
02 11 Please, Commander Hothead.
02 11 [clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
02 11 Indeed not! You see this invisible line?
02 11 Clover the Clever?
02 11 That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows, there could be jewels inside.
02 11 Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!
02 11 Give me my rock!
02 11 [arguing over rock]
02 11 You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
02 11 How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
02 11 Pegasi are brutes!
02 11 Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.
02 13 I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
02 13 Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
02 13 Moi? Babysit? N- oh nonononononononono. - I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
02 14 Oh, something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
02 14 Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!
02 14 Yes, why are you here?
02 14 And you are...?
02 14 Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.
02 14 And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
02 14 Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
02 14 Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
02 14 That was rude!
02 14 What? Pinkie- [screams]
02 14 [crunch]
02 14 [coughs]
02 14 [railway crossing bells]
02 14 When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
02 15 This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
02 15 Of course.
02 15 Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...
02 16 She's dazzling!
02 16 [gasp]
02 16 Ohh.
02 16 And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
02 16 Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
02 16 How's our patient doing today?
02 16 Oh, well don't mind us Rainbow Dash.
02 16 Uh, on second thought-
02 16 Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
02 16 Pardon?
02 19 Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
02 19 You've got to stop being such a doormat.
02 19 A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
02 19 Watch and learn. Hold it right there, mister small and handsome.
02 19 Oh, of course, you. Nopony ever called you handsome before?
02 19 Oh, well they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me? [gasps] Oh my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
02 19 [bit clinking]
02 19 See, that's not so hard, is it?
02 19 Alright then! What else is on your list?
02 19 [giggles]
02 19 So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
02 19 It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
02 19 Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
02 19 Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
02 19 Old Rarity agrees.
02 19 Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!
02 19 No sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
02 19 What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.
02 19 Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!
02 19 [gasps]
02 19 [starts crying] I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
02 19 [crying]
02 19 [knocks, clears throat] Fluttershy, are you in there?
02 19 Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
02 19 Shh.
02 19 [muffled] Sweetie, [normal] Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.
02 19 Yes! [muffled] You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
02 19 Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
02 19 What a darling little catchphrase.
02 19 [gasps] I'm sure a big, brave, powerful and rich monster- I mean, minotaur, like you, doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later.
02 19 Do something!
02 19 [wood crunching]
02 19 In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!
02 19 Friends.
02 19 [laughing]
02 20 What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
02 21 Yoo-hoo! Well?
02 21 [party horns]
02 21 What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
02 21 Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
02 21 [hushed] And 'formidable'.
02 21 You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
02 21 My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
02 21 Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
02 21 The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
02 21 Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red, it is most becoming.
02 21 Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
02 21 Hey guys!
02 21 Good morning!
02 21 An early start?
02 21 What?!?
02 21 Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutsey-wutsey head!
02 21 Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!
02 21 I suppose not.
02 21 We know.
02 21 Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!
02 21 [through her grin] We're following him, right?
02 21 Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous: one of my finer creations.
02 21 We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
02 21 Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow.
02 21 Forever?!
02 21 Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
02 21 [screams]
02 21 And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
02 21 Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
02 21 [dragons laughing]
02 21 [yelps]
02 21 [squeaks]
02 23 Ohh, Sweetie Belle... was she raised in a barn or something? [gasps] Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity... Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity. Hello... what's this? [giggles] Gum on their bum! [laughs] Too rich!
02 23 Bleh! I, I was just-
02 23 Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!
02 23 It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
02 23 Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new-
02 23 Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!
02 23 We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
02 23 Oh, lighten up, Twilight, there's nothing but harmless gossip!
02 23 [splash]
02 23 Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
02 23 Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this.
02 23 Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they dese- [gasps] I'll >destroy her! “The Drama-Queen Diaries”... she's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!
02 23 [gasps] My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely-
02 23 -most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
02 23 Et tu, Gabby Gums?!
02 23 The gilded pages of your betrayal!
02 23 How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?
02 23 What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
02 23 Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
02 24 I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
02 24 MMMM?
02 24 Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
02 24 [gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style every now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.
02 24 Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes. Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
02 24 You just made it sound so delectable.
02 24 I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
02 24 Terribly sorry.
02 25 Ahh!
02 25 [running footsteps]
02 25 It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
02 25 [running footsteps]
02 25 Princess Celestia wants me to- [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!
02 25 [thump]
02 25 [screech] So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a Captain of the Royal Guard?
02 25 Ooh, ooh, oooh!
02 25 [thump]
02 25 I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
02 25 Now let's get going, we've got work to do!
02 25 Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]
02 25 [stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!
02 25 Oh, yes, of course.
02 25 Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!
02 25 Well of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
02 25 The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
02 25 [thump]
02 25 Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
02 25 Told you she was an absolute gem!
02 25 Ehm - I'll see what I can do.
02 26 AND MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
03 01 They flew a flag of many hues
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
03 01 It is so on!
