01 01 Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean, no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
01 01 [yelp]
01 01 [very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
01 01 [even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
01 01 [squeaking]
01 01 [squeaking]
01 01 [gasp] A baby dragon!
01 01 [thump]
01 01 Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!
01 01 Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
01 01 Wait, wait! What's his name?
01 01 Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?
01 01 Absolutely everything.
01 01 Oh, yes, please!
01 01 Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
01 01 Ready?
01 02 Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
01 02 Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
01 02 [animal roar]
01 02 Wait.
01 02 Wait.
01 02 Wait!
01 02 WAIT!
01 02 Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
01 02 Now this might hurt for just a second.
01 02 [giggles] Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are.
01 02 I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
01 02 [scream]
01 02 Why Rarity, it's so lovely.
01 02 No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
01 02 [gasp]
01 03 [gasp] Angel, these are perfect.
01 03 Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be alright, if you haven't given it to someone else--
01 03 Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much The Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!
01 03 [humming]
01 03 Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
01 03 Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea.
01 03 Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
01 03 Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
01 03 Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
01 04 Twilight?
01 04 Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
01 04 Dizzy?
01 04 Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.
01 04 Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
01 04 Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
01 04 Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
01 04 Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
01 04 Oh no.
01 04 Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.
01 05 Alright little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.
01 05 Please excuse me.
01 05 Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to...
01 05 B-b-b-but I... I...
01 05 [bleat] [sobs]
01 05 Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
01 05 Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean–
01 05 I'm a year older than you.
01 07 [spits] Not too fast now, Angel bunny. You don't wanna get a tummy ache. [chuckles] You really should eat more than that, don't you think? It's not play time yet. I know you want to run, but... just three more bites. Two more bites? One more bite? Pretty please? [sighs]
01 07 Oh, goodness. Are you okay?
01 07 Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
01 07 Because you need some water?
01 07 [gasp] Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes.
01 07 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 07 [ponies conversing in the background]
01 07 Help. Help! Please? Help? There's-- there's a horrible cloud of smoke. It's headed this way and-- aaa!
01 07 Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for--
01 07 There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And--
01 07 We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be--
01 07 Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need every pony to--
01 07 That's what I've been trying to--
01 07 Oh, thank goodness.
01 07 A... d-dragon?
01 07 Huh?
01 07 [gasp]
01 07 Um, actually...
01 07 [squeak]
01 07 Um, let's... not? [squeak]
01 07 M-m-mountain?
01 07 [gulp] Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but...
01 07 But if I could just have a second...
01 07 So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville.
01 07 Oh! Good. I'll stay here and--
01 07 I don't think I--
01 07 I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... But... But... [whine]
01 07 [squeal]
01 07 But... but...! [scream]
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 [gasp]
01 07 It-- it's so... high!
01 07 I-it's so... so... steep.
01 07 Oh... okay. [soft cry]
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 [whines]
01 07 [soft grunts]
01 07 [whine]
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 [goat bleat]
01 07 [gulp]
01 07 But... it's so... wide.
01 07 I--
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 I don't know.
01 07 O-okay. Here I go. A hop.
01 07 Skip.
01 07 [whine]
01 07 I guess I forgot to jump.
01 07 An... an ava... ava...
01 07 AVALA--!
01 07 [collective sigh]
01 07 [rumble]
01 07 [sigh] Sorry.
01 07 [sigh] [whine]
01 07 [whimper]
01 07 I-- I-- I can't go in the cave.
01 07 I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble].
01 07 I'm scared of [mumble].
01 07 I'm scared of dragons!
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 Yes, because they're not dragons.
01 07 Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
01 07 Yes, because he not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
01 07 [dragon snore]
01 07 [whimper]
01 07 I was afraid to.
01 07 I-- I-- I just... can't.
01 07 How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully. You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?
01 07 Well?
01 07 And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
01 07 Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?
01 07 There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all.
01 07 It's okay, Rainbow Dash. Not every pony can be as brave as me. [scream]
01 07 [goat bleat]
01 07 [laughter]
01 07 [music]
01 07 [credits]
01 09 She's mysterious.
01 09 Animals care for themselves...
01 09 And then, she digs at the ground.
01 09 What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
01 09 [Pinkie Pie sings "Evil Enchantress" in the background]
01 09 The door's open.
01 09 ... it's a curse.
01 09 [deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
01 09 [Spike snorts, then bursts out laughing]
01 09 Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.
01 09 Oopsie! Sorry.
01 09 Uh... Spike? Are you coming?
01 09 [sigh]
01 09 She's an evil enchantress
01 09 She does evil dances
01 09 And if you look deep in her eyes
01 09 She'll put you in trances
01 09 Then what will she do?
01 09 She'll mix up an evil brew
01 09 Then she'll gobble you up
01 09 In a big tasty stew
01 09 Soooo.... Watch out!
01 09 You made me sound ridiculous!
01 09 And the chanting?
01 09 [normal voice] ... Yes.
01 09 [All ponies laugh]
01 09 [credits]
01 10 La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
01 10 Gah!
01 10 Hello little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
01 10 Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry.
01 10 You're the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to show you to my friends.
01 10 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 10 Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
01 10 You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
01 10 [gasp] Three?
01 10 I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
01 10 Pinkie, do you want the other one?
01 10 Ugh?
01 10 How could you not like...
01 10 I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
01 10 What do we do?
01 10 Ouch.
01 10 [gasps]
01 10 Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
01 10 What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
01 11 We wake up all their sleepy heads
01 11 So quietly and nice
01 11 We welcome back the southern birds
01 11 So their families can grow!
01 11 Wake up little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
01 11 Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.
01 11 It's like a long sleep.
01 11 Yes. [bell rings] Wake up little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
01 11 Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens, I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
01 11 You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.
01 11 Good morning friends.
01 11 Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
01 11 No, you simply must wait.
01 11 Stop.
01 11 Stop.
01 11 STOP!
01 11 No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.
01 14 It's... nice.
01 14 Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine.
01 14 Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?
01 14 I... love it.
01 14 No, no. I do. It's... nice.
01 14 Nice.
01 14 Oh, but I do like it.
01 14 Um... both?
01 14 Please stop asking me this, I...
01 14 No, that's okay...
01 14 No... it's fine...
01 14 I... like it...
01 14 All right! Since you really wanna know... [inhales] The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch and the overdesign is reminiscent of pret-a-porter and not true French haute couture. [pauses] But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine.
01 14 French haute couture, please.
01 14 Making sure we make a good appearance
01 14 It's... perfect!
01 14 Uh... panic?
01 14 Do you like it?
01 14 Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
01 14 We just followed your brilliant design.
01 15 Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.
01 15 [muffled] Bye-bye!
01 15 Of course.
01 15 Oh, I'm so sorry.
01 15 [hydra roars]
01 15 Ah!
01 15 [Hydra head laughs]
01 15 [ponies and Spike screaming]
01 15 A hop, skip, and a... jump!
01 16 Loss of control.
01 16 Screaming and hollering.
01 16 Passion!
01 16 [breathes in] Yay.
01 16 Yay.
01 16 Yay.
01 16 [deep breath] [quietly] Yaay.
01 16 ...Too loud?
01 16 Yay.
01 16 Wooo.
01 16 Way to go.
01 16 Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo. [gasp] Did my cheering do that?
01 16 Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
01 16 Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
01 16 Yay.
01 16 She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.
01 16 Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom!
01 16 Then show up at the Cloudseum and see for yourself!.. If you're free.
01 16 Did you see that? I was so assertive!
01 16 But Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
01 16 ... Rare...
01 16 Rarity?
01 16 It's incredible!
01 16 Uhh... C'mon girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!
01 16 My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
01 16 Look! Phase two is working. [group starts cheering again]
01 16 Oh, I can't look!
01 16 A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! WOOO!
01 16 A sonic rainboom! Wooo! YEAH!
01 16 It's ok.
01 17 Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
01 17 No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket.
01 17 Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?
01 17 [gasp]
01 17 These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?
01 17 Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
01 17 What does that patch on your cape mean?
01 17 I, ah, I suppose I could take them for the night.
01 17 Oh, it's no problem at all.
01 17 Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
01 17 Come on, it'll be fun.
01 17 These sweet little angels?
01 17 So cute. W-wait for me!
01 17 Oh, won't this be ever so fun. We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each other's tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and--
01 17 [rush of air, clattering hooves]
01 17 Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?
01 17 Th-the Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
01 17 Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
01 17 What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.
01 17 [crickets chirping quietly, owl hooting]
01 17 [door closes]
01 17 [to herself] No problem at all. [normal] Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?
01 17 Girls?
01 17 Should we--
01 17 Girls, okay, now settle --
01 17 I-I know you're excited, but-- girls, oh, oh, careful with the-- oh, ah, girls--
01 17 [Fluttershy moves her mane off her face with a puff]
01 17 So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?
01 17 Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?
01 17 Oh, no. The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
01 17 Um, oh, maybe that's not such a-- now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring. Dhh--
01 17 Careful... you don't...
01 17 [crash]
01 17 ...break anything.
01 17 Oh, girls, it's okay. I--
01 17 C-carpenters?
01 17 Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
01 17 It's called "Shhh!"
01 17 Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun? I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me! [squee] [draws a deep breath]
01 17 [sigh]
01 17 NO!
01 17 I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
01 17 Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?
01 17 [blows out candle] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
01 17 How about I sing you a lullaby?
01 17 [clears throat]
01 17 Hush now, quiet now
01 17 It's time to lay your sleepy head
01 17 Hush now, quiet now
01 17 It's time to go to bed
01 17 Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?
01 17 Okay Sweetie, that was...
01 17 Thank you Sweetie, um...
01 17 Okay, Sweetie, that was...
01 17 Thank you, Sweetie, um...
01 17 [chickens clucking and flapping]
01 17 [gasp] Girls!
01 17 No, I don't think that's a-- ah, come back! Please!
01 17 [Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling, more chicken flapping and squawking]
01 17 Come on, girls, the chickens are fine-- oh, girls, um... GIRLS!
01 17 [chickens flapping and clucking]
01 17 Come on, in you go.
01 17 [eerie music]
01 17 There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?
01 17 Please?
01 17 So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
01 17 Okay, good night.
01 17 [sigh] It really wasn't THAT hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids.
01 17 [quiet galloping]
01 17 [tearing fabric]
01 17 Mmm, peace and quiet. [gasps] Too quiet. [gasps] Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! GIRLS? [gasps] Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into... [gasp] [gulp] The Everfree Forest!
01 17 Those girls have really done it this time! They've really bitten off more than they can chew! Oh, just like me! I never should have offered to watch them. [draws a deep breath]
01 17 (whispering) Girls? [gulp] Girls? [tiny terrified squeak] Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other.
01 17 [twig snaps]
01 17 Ahh! What was that?
01 17 [thump]
01 17 [scream]
01 17 [rush of air, clattering hooves]
01 17 Twilight? I-is that you? Oh, Twilight, it is you. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're-- [gasps] Oh! What's happened to you? [scream]
01 17 [Twilight falls over]
01 17 Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean-- oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move; I'll be back for you. GIRLS!
01 17 Girls? Girls?
01 17 Girls? Thank goodness I found you!
01 17 Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
01 17 There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
01 17 A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!
01 17 NO! Never look one in the eye. If you look a cockatrice in the eye--
01 17 [brush rustling, a chicken cluck]
01 17 Girls! Wait!
01 17 See? Now we have to --
01 17 Girls, please. Girls-- now listen to me, girls, I-- please!
01 17 [screaming]
01 17 [cockatrice squawking]
01 17 GIRLS! Behind me, NOW!
01 17 [cockatrice squawking and roaring]
01 17 YOU! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
01 17 You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?
01 17 Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
01 17 Oh, you DO, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... The Stare.
01 17 [giggling]
01 17 And that's when it brought you back from stone.
01 17 Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
01 17 I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.
01 17 Did you finish all those capes?
01 17 Won't you stay for some tea?
01 17 Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?
01 17 Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
01 17 I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
01 17 Of course. How about later today?
01 17 [Opal yowls]
01 17 [giggling]
01 17 [closing credits]
01 19 Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!
01 19 But they blocked up all the holes.
01 19 Oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
01 19 Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
01 20 Is everything all right?
01 20 Photo Finish?
01 20 What a lovely compliment.
01 20 That's wonderful.
01 20 Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
01 20 Oh, goodness. I don't know.
01 20 I'm flattered, really.
01 20 But...
01 20 There has to be somepony more quali...
01 20 Somepony more into fashion.
01 20 Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
01 20 Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.
01 20 What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
01 20 A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
01 20 I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
01 20 Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything.
01 20 Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
01 20 I can't, Rarity.
01 20 [sneeze]
01 20 N... nervous.
01 20 You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
01 20 Oh, yes. Best time ever...
01 20 I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?
01 20 Photo Finish?
01 20 Um... Photo Finish?
01 20 Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.
01 20 Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
01 20 Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?
01 20 Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated I could just scream. [squeak]
01 20 No. Can I tell you something?
01 20 You promise not to tell Rarity?
01 20 Pinkie Pie-swear?
01 20 I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I MUST! [sigh] I must...
01 20 Oh, what were you about to say?
01 20 Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.
01 20 Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!
01 20 You really think it'll work?
01 20 This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
01 20 [kicks a vase, vase wobbles]
01 20 If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
01 20 I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
01 20 You did?!
01 20 Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.
01 20 More than anything.
01 20 I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria".
01 20 Never!
01 20 If we just told each other the truth.
01 20 Me too.
01 20 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
01 20 I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.
01 20 We go!
01 20 Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
01 21 Awwww!
01 21 I'd like to be a tree...
01 21 Huffy the magic dragon!
01 21 A stampede of buffalo.
01 21 And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
01 21 But why?
01 21 Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
01 21 [indistinct "Oh, there you are!" "Thank goodness!"]
01 22 There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all.
01 22 Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.
01 22 You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
01 22 [a clock strikes four]
01 22 I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go?
01 22 [fanfares]
01 22 Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it! [departs, then returns] Oh, thanks, Angel. [and again] I mean, if if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered and then... then I wouldn't be there and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late.
01 22 Oh, okay then. See you later.
01 22 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 22 Phew. Made it.
01 22 [gulp] No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
01 22 Thanks, Twilight.
01 22 Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
01 22 Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
01 22 But she's met us all before.
01 22 Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
01 22 Or... perhaps not that casual.
01 22 It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice.
01 22 Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.
01 22 Yes, I love to take care of animals.
01 22 Oh... my.
01 22 I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
01 22 Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly. I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help.
01 22 Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.
01 22 There.
01 22 This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!
01 22 Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.
01 22 Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
01 22 Always works.
01 22 Uh... Almost always.
01 22 There's nothing like home-made soup
01 22 to cure what ails you.
01 22 Come on now. You'd not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.
01 22 Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here come the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
01 22 Oh dear.
01 22 Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing.
01 22 Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy? Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
01 22 Aw, look. I think he likes you.
01 22 Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it.
01 22 Um... good try?
01 22 I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?
01 22 Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...
01 22 Aromatherapy?
01 22 Warm bath?
01 22 Ointment?
01 22 Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
01 22 Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever.
01 22 I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
01 22 How could I just walk away and not do anything?
01 22 I had to do something.
01 22 But...
01 22 But...
01 22 [sigh] You're right. Okay, let's...
01 22 ...go.
01 22 [excessive coughing]
01 22 But it's daytime.
01 22 Going to return Philomena, remember?
01 22 Why not?
01 22 Do you?
01 22 You really think the princess would do that?
01 22 All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
01 22 Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the Princess. And everything will be fine.
01 22 I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
01 22 She can't fly.
01 22 Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.
01 22 I don't think she likes it.
01 22 Of course, but...
01 22 Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.
01 22 It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
01 22 I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
01 22 No! Philomena! Come back!
01 22 Excuse me!
01 22 Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!
01 22 I'll catch you!
01 22 [gasps]
01 22 [cries/whimpers]
01 22 It's all my fault.
01 22 I'm the one who did it.
01 22 Some help I was.
01 22 But it's my fault!
01 22 Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.
01 22 I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
01 22 A... A phoenix?
01 22 So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
01 22 I guess I have some imagination.
01 22 I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
01 22 It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.
01 23 All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?
01 23 Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
01 23 Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
01 23 You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer.
01 23 It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere...
01 23 [voiceover] I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I've never been near the ground before.
01 23 What is this place
01 23 filled with so many wonders?
01 23 Casting its spell
01 23 That I am now under
01 23 Squirrels in the trees
01 23 and the cute little bunnies
01 23 Birds flying free
01 23 and bees with their honey
01 23 Hooneeeeey!
01 23 Oooh, what a magical place
01 23 and I owe it all to the Pegasus race
01 23 If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
01 23 I'd have come here sooner, and never leave
01 23 Yes, I love everythiiiiiiiiiiiing!
01 23 [explosion]
01 23 [voiceover] Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
01 23 Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.
01 23 Bye, girls!
01 23 Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
01 23 Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
01 23 I'm so glad we're friends!
01 23 Hey. How about a song?
01 24 He's just wonderful.
01 24 Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
01 25 You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
01 25 It’s been lovely.
01 25 As in…?
01 25 It’s… uh… a big house.
01 25 He’s… a bear.
01 25 It’s, uh, really more of a cave.
01 25 And, uh, he wants us to look after his house… uh, cave… while he’s, uh…
01 25 [over Rainbow Dash] Collect sea shells! ...Play beach volleyball! ...Collect volleyballs!
01 25 Not since this morning.
01 25 I’m just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn’t be there.
01 25 As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
01 25 [gasp] [scream]
01 25 [in unison] Surprise!
01 25 I really thought she’d be more excited.
01 25 Don’t worry about it.
01 25 Oh, definitely.
01 26 Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?
01 26 Opalescence, no!
01 26 At the Gala, in the garden
01 26 I'm going to see them all!
01 26 All the creatures, I'll befriend them at the Gala! (at the Gala!)
01 26 All the birdies, and the critters
01 26 They will love me big and small!
01 26 We'll become good friends forever
01 26 Right here at the Gala!
01 26 Meet new friends
01 26 To meet!
01 26 Oh my! A meadowlark!
01 26 [whistling]
01 26 I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for! [humming]
01 26 [whistling]
01 26 [humming]
01 26 [whistling]
01 26 [sigh] My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
01 26 [whistling]
01 26 Was that you?
01 26 Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
01 26 [animal noises]
01 26 Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?
01 26 Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.
01 26 This isn't what I wished for.
01 26 ...for this moment.
01 26 I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says. [loudly] I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
01 26 [sound of crunching]
01 26 Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
01 26 COME OUT!
01 26 I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be MINE! MINE!!! [scariest laughter you'll ever hear] Whoa!
01 26 You're... going to LOVE ME!
01 26 Talking!
02 01 Now, Angel, you really shouldn't– No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!
02 01 Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
02 01 [squeal]
02 01 Can we go home now?
02 01 W-We have to go in there?
02 01 [scream]
02 01 [gasping] What's that? Who's there? Girls!
02 01 Okay, I can do this. I can...  [scream] Oh, Wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!
02 01 Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
02 01 Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
02 01 Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.
02 01 Aw, boo hoo hoo! [Twilight is shocked] Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
02 01 Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one.
02 01 [Fluttershy whips her tail in Twilight's face]
02 02 Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha.
02 02 No. Ha, ha.
02 02 No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
02 02 Ha, ha.
02 02 I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha.
02 02 Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud.
02 02 Don't worry, you won't. [laughter]
02 02 With pleasure.
02 02 'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
02 02 Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
02 02 Your face! [bang]
02 02 Hah!
02 02 [sing-song voice] Keep away!
02 02 Hmph! Garbage.
02 02 [mockingly] Oops, sorry, Rainbow Crash. [chuckle]
02 02 Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
02 02 Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!
02 02 Uh? She's not here.
02 02 Got it!
02 02 Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
02 02 [whimper/crying] I can't!
02 02 That big...dumb...MEANIE!
02 03 [assorted grunts]
02 03 [continued assorted grunts]
02 03 You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
02 03 [various shock statements]
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 [sighs of relief]
02 03 Oh thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened.
02 03 [giggles]
02 03 Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
02 03 Why would you enchant your doll?
02 03 Magic kindergarten?
02 03 Please, your highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset...
02 03 Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
02 03 Mmhmm.
02 03 [All right, etc]
02 03 [cheering]
02 03 We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
02 03 [laughs]
02 04 Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
02 04 It is you. Oh, and Nightmare Moon. [gasp] Nightmare Moon?!
02 04 Likewise.
02 04 [quiet] Okay.
02 04 [whispered] Okay.
02 04 [quiet] Okay.
02 04 [hurriedly] Perfectlessonover.
02 04 [nervous, dazed laughter] Yes.
02 07 I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
02 07 Oh, please don't be mad at us.
02 07 Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house. Oh, and I know you'll just love them, and they'll love you, oh! And you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!
02 07 Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight
02 07 It's abundantly clear
02 07 That somewhere out here
02 07 Is the pet that will suit you just right
02 07 Awesome, cool, got it!
02 07 I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see
02 07 Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
02 07 They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
02 07 Rainbow, have faith
02 07 You see, I will bet you
02 07 Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you
02 07 Come on, the sky's the limit!
02 07 Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!
02 07 I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide
02 07 There are otters and seals
02 07 With massive appeal
02 07 Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
02 07 Wait! There must be a pet here
02 07 That will fit the ticket
02 07 How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?
02 07 Bigger, cooler. Right.
02 07 I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash
02 07 Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely
02 07 Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!
02 07 I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
02 07 I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky
02 07 Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
02 07 I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?
02 07 There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that
02 07 There are falcons and eagles
02 07 They are both quite regal
02 07 Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?
02 07 Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.
02 07 No.
02 07 I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you
02 07 Don't forget style, that should be considered
02 07 The one who is awesome as cool
02 07 So a contest we will see
02 07 In the world for me
02 07 May the games
02 07 Begin
02 07 Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and-
02 07 Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here.
02 07 Oh, just let him try.
02 07 It won't hurt to let him try.
02 07 Just let him try?
02 07 Tortoise.
02 07 Where's Rainbow Dash?
02 07 It's the turtle!
02 07 ...whatever...
02 07 Maybe we'd better go meet him half way.
02 07 Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
02 07 The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?
02 07 Yay?
02 07 But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
02 08 She really cares about everypony's safety.
02 08 Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.
02 09 Oh, poor Opal, where is the sick darling?
02 09 Poor baby.
02 09 She looks awful.
02 10 Happy birthday, Spike.
02 10 [screams]
02 10 I'm up here!
02 10 I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
02 10 Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
02 10 Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!
02 10 I- if you wouldn't mind, that is...
02 10 We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
02 10 [screaming]
02 10 [splash]
02 10 [gasps] We did it! I can't believe we did it!
02 11 I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting! [softly] Woo hoo!
02 11 Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!
02 11 No?
02 11 So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
02 11 A lot?
02 11 Hundreds?
02 11 [yelps]
02 11 [bang]
02 11 [wind rushing]
02 11 Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?
02 11 [yelps]
02 11 Conquer, sir?
02 11 I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow.
02 11 [yelps]
02 11 What a view... I can see my future house from here.
02 11 I vote for calm.
02 11 [gasp] [sigh]
02 11 [windigo roaring]
02 11 [screams]
02 11 What is that... thing?
02 11 Windigos?
02 11 Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.
02 11 Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
02 11 What was that?
02 13 Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me are you? Please don't be mad at me!
02 14 Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
02 14 I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling.
02 14 [gasps] Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.
02 14 Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
02 14 I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
02 14 We're so glad you're safe!
02 14 Are you okay?
02 14 Um, excuse me?
02 14 Ooh... Can you please slow down?
02 14 Help!
02 14 STOP!
02 14 [splat]
02 14 [panting]
02 14 Nn-nn.
02 14 Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
02 15 [yawns] Who could that be? It's still dark!
02 15 [crash]
02 15 [squee] [shrieks] Oh, where are we? What's the rush?
02 15 Um, well, uh-
02 15 I guess I-
02 15 Gee Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
02 15 [zipping noise]
02 15 Oh, gosh Pinkie. I love your new style.
02 15 For the record, I don't mind-
02 15 Uh, Pinkie Pie-
02 15 Got it.
02 16 [muffled] Oh, I'm so worried!
02 16 It's not so bad Rainbow Dash.
02 16 Hi Rainbow Dash!
02 16 We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
02 16 We know how much you like to win!
02 16 Um... sky five?
02 16 But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
02 16 Glad we could... cheer you up?
02 19 Lunch time! Who's hungry? Plenty for everypony. Slow down, sweetie. [giggles]
02 19 Here you go, Angel bunny.
02 19 Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum! What? But- Then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of- [sighs] I'll make your special recipe.
02 19 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 19 Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me... umm... I think you just stepped in front of me...? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first and-
02 19 I know.
02 19 Oh, pardon me, sir-
02 19 I think you just cut in front of me.
02 19 I said [into ear trumpet] I think you just cut in front of me.
02 19 I noticed.
02 19 Hey!
02 19 But-
02 19 Oh, okay. There's no rush.
02 19 Oh, it-it's really no big deal...
02 19 What problem? Oh, go right ahead Pinkie Pie, you first.
02 19 A doormat?
02 19 Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good!
02 19 [bit clinking]
02 19 Oh, that's okay, I don't mind.
02 19 ...um... I guess not.
02 19 Let's see... I also need tomatoes.
02 19 [bit clinking]
02 19 Here you go.
02 19 Oh, but last week it was only one bit.
02 19 Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it.
02 19 I guess you're right!
02 19 Um... okay. [to self] I need that cherry. [to cherry stallholder] Boy am I glad you have one cherry left. You see I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel, he's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
02 19 [bit clinking]
02 19 Here you go.
02 19 Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!
02 19 Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
02 19 Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits!
02 19 Umm...I mean, nine bits!
02 19 Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
02 19 It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
02 19 But... I was only doing what you did.
02 19 But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
02 19 Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!
02 19 Tada! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel? [sighs] Look at me... I really am a doormat. [reading from pamphlet] The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre. As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!
02 19 [ponies chattering]
02 19 Oh! Ah! Uh... excuse me! [squeaks]
02 19 [kick]
02 19 [thump]
02 19 [music playing on Eye of the Tiger starts]
02 19 [goats bleat]
02 19 [fireworks explode]
02 19 [ponies cheering]
02 19 Who, me?
02 19 [gulps] Uh, well...
02 19 [whispering] Okay.
02 19 Um, politely walk around him?
02 19 Gingerly tip-toe around him?
02 19 Go back home and try again tomorrow?
02 19 Oh! Sorry.
02 19 Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won’t be sorry when I do!
02 19 Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to “attack the day”, as Iron Will says.
02 19 [water spraying]
02 19 Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias...
02 19 ...again...
02 19 “Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over.”
02 19 Thank you. [excited giggle] I can't believe it worked!
02 19 [clears throat] Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
02 19 A-hemmmm, can you move, you're blocking my path.
02 19 “When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!”
02 19 Good!
02 19 What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?
02 19 'Maybe'? “Maybes are for babies!” [growling] Now go to the back of the line where you belong!
02 19 [VCR rewind sound]
02 19 Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work.
02 19 Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
02 19 “You laugh at me, I wrath at you!”
02 19 [crash]
02 19 Bye, girls.
02 19 [ponies running away]
02 19 What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. “Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!”
02 19 [fight sounds]
02 19 Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around! [screams] Nopony!
02 19 You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!
02 19 And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
02 19 “You apologize, I penalize!"
02 19 [crash]
02 19 [bites]
02 19 [mail cart zooms in and out]
02 19 [muffled] Sure, you just- [gasps]
02 19 [growls] “You make me lose, I blow my fuse!”
02 19 Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
02 19 What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
02 19 No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!
02 19 Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?
02 19 Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
02 19 Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
02 19 Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur! [growls] ...I'm the monster.
02 19 [wind blows]
02 19 [wolf howls]
02 19 [muffled] Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
02 19 [muffled] Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame. [normal] But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
02 19 I, I'm not sure I can, I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself I become a monster.
02 19 [lightning strikes]
02 19 [sneezes]
02 19 Um, no.
02 19 [goat bleats]
02 19 No.
02 19 As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied.
02 19 Well I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that.
02 19 [goats bleating]
02 19 I'm sorry, but no means no.
02 19 Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?
02 19 [laughing]
02 19 Dear Princess Celestia, sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant, or mean.
02 19 [credits]
02 20 [grunts] Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
02 20 [crash]
02 20 Oh!
02 20 [horn blowing]
02 20 Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
02 20 Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
02 21 There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes. Fun, no.
02 21 Now that you put it that way, yes!
02 21 Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
02 21 Thanks, but... no thanks!
02 21 I said... no!
02 21 [high pitched growling] [whimpers]
02 22 Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash. [coughs weakly]
02 22 Oh, I [sniffs] I think I have [coughs weakly] the pony pox. I'm sorry, I really, really wanted to come to training day today [coughs weakly] but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop. Achoo. [coughs weakly]
02 22 I know, plenty of bed-
02 22 [splash]
02 22 [yelps]
02 22 Oh, y'know, all of a sudden I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] I'll just get out of these robes and- ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt, I guess I can't fly after all-
02 22 [yelps]
02 22 Well, y'see, uh, well, oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!
02 22 But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
02 22 You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!
02 22 The other foals used to tease me, a lot!
02 22 I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
02 22 Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...
02 22 Wait. I'll do it.
02 22 I will.
02 22 I'm game.
02 22 [takes deep breath]
02 22 [crying]
02 22 [crying] Yes!
02 22 I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now...
02 22 [squeaks] [crying]
02 22 [squirrel chittering]
02 22 Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
02 22 [duck quacking]
02 22 I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
02 22 [birds chirp]
02 22 I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
02 22 [badger squeaking]
02 22 Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...
02 22 [badger squeaking]
02 22 ...and you were scared...
02 22 [badger squeaking]
02 22 ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!
02 22 [animal noises]
02 22 [training montage music begins]
02 22 2.3. 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
02 22 No I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power by tomorrow!
02 22 How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
02 22 Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
02 22 Twilight!
02 22 I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
02 22 Oh no! That's terrible news!
02 22 [water splashing]
02 22 [crunch]
02 22 Oh, I'm too nervous to look!
02 22 I won't make a difference!
02 22 My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
02 22 [gulps] [yelps]
02 22 No!
02 22 Whuh, what? Did we do it?
02 22 Ah!
02 22 Dear Princess Celestia, sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.

02 23 [muffled crying]
02 24 [Gasp] Oh my.
02 24 So did I.
02 24 So tasty.
02 24 And it was so good.
02 24 But I'm really really sorry.
02 25 Oh my goodness! What an honor!
02 25 Um, Twilight? Are you okay?
02 25 She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
02 25 But... he was singing really off-key.
02 25 [bird sings off-key]
02 25 Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
02 25 [excited chatter]
02 25 Oh goodness! Are you okay?
02 26 Rarity!
03 01 Oh, um. Excuse me! Oh! Hello! I was just wondering. Oh, oh that's okay. You all look really busy.
03 01 They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
