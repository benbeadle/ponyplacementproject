01 01 [sheepish laughter] Uh, 'scuse me? [more sheepish laughter]
01 01  Lemme help you.
01 01 [rushing water]
01 01 [more sheepish laughter] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no, don't thank me, you're quite welcome. [bursts out laughing]
01 01 The one and only. Why, you heard of me?
01 01 Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
01 01 The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
01 01 Yep!
01 01 That's them!
01 01 Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
01 01 [sounds of exertion] Loop the loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing]  You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.
01 01 What did you do with our Princess?!
01 02 Come back here!  Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
01 02 And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!
01 02 Nopony knows. You know why?
01 02 'cause every pony who's ever come in, has never come OUT.
01 02 
01 02 Fluttershy! Quick!
01 02 And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
01 02 I'm on it.
01 02 Little?
01 02 Right here... guh...
01 02 Then what is?
01 02 Oh, give me a break.
01 02 So would the mustache.
01 02 What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
01 02 Duh.
01 02 Who's there?
01 02 I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
01 02 Who?
01 02 Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever.
01 02 Yep.
01 02 Yes.
01 02 Yes,  it's all true.
01 02 WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
01 02 You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
01 02 [ponies cheering]
01 02 See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
01 02 Where's the sixth?
01 02 Ugh, my head.
01 02 Aw yeah.
01 03 Whoa!  Ugh. Are we talking about The Grand Galloping Gala?
01 03 No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
01 03 YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at The Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on The Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!
01 03 [audience gasps]
01 03 I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
01 03 [audience cheers]
01 03 Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, The Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!
01 03 [ponies go wild]
01 03 The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member. Don't you see, Twilight? This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. You gotta take me! 
01 03 So? That doesn't mean you own it.
01 03 
01 03 A chance to audition for The Wonderbolts?
01 03 Living the dream.
01 03 Okay.
01 03 
01 03 Wait just a minute.
01 03 No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
01 03 Your ticket?
01 03 Hi there best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?
01 03 Whaddya you mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
01 03 Me? No no no, of course not.
01 03 Seriously, I'd do it for any pony. Heh heh, eh.
01 03 Ugh, fine. 
01 03 Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket-- you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for The Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either.
01 03 What a great way to apologize.
01 04 STAMPEDE!
01 04 [cows mooing]
01 04 [ponies panicking]
01 04 Look there!
01 04 Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
01 04 But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
01 04 Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
01 04 Tired?
01 04 There you are.
01 04 See this contraption?
01 04 Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
01 04 Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
01 04 Ready? One... two... THREE!
01 04 Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
01 04 Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
01 04 Ugh!
01 04 Wait, Applejaaaaack!
01 04 
01 04 I think somepony else needs your help.
01 04 Yep.
01 04 STAMPEDE!
01 04 [ponies scream]
01 04 Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
01 05  Pinkie Pie? Not again.
01 05 Not now, Pinkie Pie.
01 05 I'm in the middle of something.
01 05 I said not now--
01 05 
01 05 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 05 
01 05 Phew. That was close.
01 05 Aah!
01 05 
01 05 Aah!
01 05 Waaa--oh, forget it.
01 05  Okay.
01 05 Pinkie Pie!
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 I can think of one thing.
01 05 I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
01 05 You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.
01 05 You wanna hang out?
01 05 A simple nod would do.
01 05 Is she even home?
01 05 There she is.
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 
01 05 [water splash]
01 05  Fluttershy.
01 05 Yeah, you're right.  Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?
01 05 Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?
01 05  Good one, Pinkie Pie.
01 05 
01 05 Ridiculous.
01 05 Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
01 05 Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
01 05 She's half-eagle, half-lion.
01 05 Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?
01 05 Sooo...
01 05 Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.
01 05 
01 05 Yeah, only faster. So now what?
01 05 Huh?
01 05 Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
01 05 A race? You are so on.
01 05 I win.
01 05 No way.
01 05 Oh, ome on, I was way ahead of you.
01 05 Oh Geez, dream on.
01 05 There is no way you beat me.
01 05 Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.
01 05 New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.
01 05 Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
01 05 Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
01 05 Later.
01 05 Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream.
01 05 Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
01 05 G, the punch.
01 05 Ha. Priceless. Priceless. 
01 05 Hey G, look, presents.
01 05 
01 05 Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
01 05 Come on then, let's have some cake.
01 05 You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
01 05 So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
01 05 They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
01 05 And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
01 05 Not cool.
01 05 I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
01 05 I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
01 06 Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.  Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!
01 06 So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
01 06 There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
01 06 That's my job!
01 06 [electric guitar music]
01 06 They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!
01 06 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a!  I think I'm  gonna be sick.
01 06 Ow!
01 06 
01 06 Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
01 06 It's fine.
01 06 Unbelievable!
01 06 Hate you?
01 06 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.
01 06 And after whuppin' that ursa's hind quarters, we're even prouder.
01 06 Uh-huh.
01 06 Why that little...
01 07 Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven...
01 07 Three hundred fifty four...
01 07 Three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
01 07 Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
01 07 Huh?
01 07 I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that!
01 07 
01 07 Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?
01 07 Raaah!
01 07 You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets.
01 07 Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.
01 07 Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down.
01 07 Whoa. What was that?
01 07 Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!
01 07 Oh, all right.
01 07 Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
01 07 Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?
01 07 Augh.
01 07  Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever.
01 07 Told you it was going to take them forever.
01 07 Ugh.
01 07 Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
01 07 Not your fault.
01 07  Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
01 07 Mm-hmm.
01 07 Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too.
01 07 Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
01 07 Augh.
01 07 I'm not!
01 07 So much for  persuading him.
01 07 All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does.
01 07 It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
01 07 Get! Out! 
01 07 Heh. Sorry.
01 07 Who-o-o-o-o-a!
01 07 
01 07 Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
01 07 
01 07 Dragon!
01 07 [goat bleat]
01 07 
01 07  Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!
01 07 Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.
01 09 Sinister.
01 09 And the clouds move...
01 09 All on their own!
01 09 Here we go. ...
01 09 Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
01 09 W..what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
01 09 And Zecora's still out there.
01 09 Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
01 09 Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.
01 09 Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
01 09  Ow!  Oh! She's  trying to say-ow!- Zecora -oh!- she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!
01 09  I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
01 09 I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?
01 09 How about you, Applejack? Applejack?
01 09 Rarity's hair!
01 09 I bet they went after Zecora.
01 09 Hey, a little help here?
01 09  OW!
01 09 Hey, wait for me! [screaming and owing]
01 09 Ex-CUSE me?
01 09 What the...
01 09 Aaah!
01 09 
01 09 Ahh!
01 09 You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
01 09 Ok, fine. But what about the cauldron?
01 10 Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy. This is waaay too boring for me.
01 10 Ugh, sooo boooring.
01 10 What's that sound, Twilight?
01 10 Wow, what are they?
01 10 Uh, I'll take one.
01 10 [baby noises]
01 10 Huh? Huh?!    Get off me!   Waaa!
01 10 Ditto!
01 10 Guh.
01 10 Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
01 10 Aye aye.
01 10 Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
01 10 Alright. 
01 10 We call in the weather patrol. 
01 10 Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
01 10 Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Woah! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
01 10 Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
01 10 YEEEAAAA!
01 10 They're not that adorable.
01 10 Some sort of infestation.
01 11 Three months of winter coolness
01 11 And awesome holidays
01 11 –is here!
01 11 Bringing home the southern birds
01 11 A Pegasus' job begins
01 11 And clearing all the gloomy skies
01 11 To let the sunshine in
01 11 We move the clouds
01 11 And we melt the white snow
01 11 When the sun comes up
01 11 Its warmth and beauty will glow!
01 11 Alright team, you're clear for takeoff.
01 11 Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?
01 11 Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
01 11 Um...
01 11 Sorry Twilight.
01 11 Got it.
01 11 Got it.
01 11 Okay.
01 11 Ugh! Make up your minds!
01 11 Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
01 11 Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
01 11 [Ponies grumble and complain]
01 12 Wow, looks like some pony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?
01 12 Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that! 
01 12 Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
01 12 Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.
01 12 That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?
01 12 I said: Are! You! Ready!
01 12 Juggling, go! [whistle blows]
01 12 Hang-gliding, go! [whistle blows]
01 12 Karate, go! [whistle blows]
01 12 Kite-flying, go! [whistle blows]
01 12 Ultrapony Roller Derby, go! [whistle blows]
01 12 [>Roller ponies
01 12 ]
01 12 Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
01 12 Tried that one... tried that one...
01 12 Eating cupcakes?
01 13  Woo-hoo!
01 13 Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?
01 13 Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
01 13 
01 13 Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.
01 13 I lost.
01 13 I hate losing.
01 13 All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
01 13 ...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
01 13 I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
01 13 
01 13 Iron Pony competition.
01 13 The most athletic pony ever! 
01 13  I don' know. Why is she here?
01 13 Right, heh. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books. 
01 13 Thanks, but I  couldn't have been as fast as you.
01 13 Oh, I can't believe I won.
01 13 Ugh.
01 13 Ready for another pony ride?
01 13  Does this count?
01 13 Yuh
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 Yeah.
01 13 [ponies gasp]
01 13 Fluttershy: 
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 Yes!
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 [hens clucking]
01 13 [chicks chirping]
01 13 Huh?
01 13 I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
01 13 Woo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case.  I am the Iron Pony!
01 13 What?
01 13 Sounds like sour apples to me.
01 13 Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
01 13 I still would have won even without my wings.
01 13 Gladly. How?
01 13 Heh! Easy shmeasy.
01 13 No wings? No problem.
01 13 
01 13 [blows raspberry]
01 13 Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.
01 13 So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?
01 13 Yeah, yeah...
01 13 I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
01 13 Very funny.
01 13  Good one, Twilight.
01 13 What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.
01 13 Egghead.
01 13 And you know this from...
01 13 What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?  Get it? Eye muscles.
01 13 Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.
01 13 Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.
01 13 You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
01 13 Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!
01 13 Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.
01 13 Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.
01 13 Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.
01 13 Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.
01 13 Look, ma, no wings.
01 13 
01 13 [blows raspberry]
01 13 Nice one, Rainbow.
01 13  Aaa!
01 13 
01 13  I'm sure I'll win now.
01 13 Oh horse apples... See ya!
01 13 What the hay?! You said no flying!
01 13  Aaa!
01 13 Whoa!
01 13 You know, I think Twilight's right.
01 13 Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!
01 13 No, you cut it out!
01 13 And now I'm gonna finish it.
01 13 Oh yes, I will.  That's it! All bets are off!
01 13 I won!
01 13 I won!
01 13 Tied?!
01 13 Then who won?
01 13 YOU?
01 13 You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
01 13 I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
01 13 We weren't very good sports.
01 13 Princess Celestia?!
01 13 I'd love to stretch my legs.
01 13 
01 13 
01 14 Look out below!
01 14 Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
01 14 Outfit for the what now?
01 14 Oh, I love fun things!
01 14 Yeah, they're...
01 14 Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
01 14 What?
01 14 No, I just want my dress to be cool.
01 14 The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
01 14 The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler.
01 14 All we really like is what we know
01 14 It's cool!
01 14 That's so cool!
01 14 You think we overdid it?
01 14 She kind of is.
01 14 That's your answer for everything!
01 14 Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
01 14 You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
01 16 Now, what have we learned?
01 16 Good.
01 16 Yes, and most importantly?
01 16 Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
01 16 ... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
01 16 Louder!
01 16 Louder!
01 16 Ugh...
01 16 [deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine.
01 16 Phase two.
01 16 Here we go. Phase three. The sonic rainboom. C'mon!  Uh-oh. 
01 16 
01 16 
01 16 Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. THAT was a truly feeble performance.
01 16 Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!
01 16  I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
01 16 Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
01 16 It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
01 16 Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
01 16 The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my life-long heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
01 16 I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. YOU, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
01 16 You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.
01 16 I didn't get kicked out.
01 16  Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
01 16 Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Every pony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
01 16 Rare?! The sonic rainboom is WAY more than rare!
01 16 Rarity! Are you... flying?!
01 16 We?.. I... I can't believe it!
01 16 This is so cool! You guys made it!
01 16 WAIT!.. How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
01 16 To be honest, I was starting to get just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a LOT better now that you guys are here.
01 16 Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
01 16 Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
01 16 Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
01 16 Great idea! C'mon girls. To the weather factory!
01 16 This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
01 16 We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
01 16 And here's where they make the rainbows!
01 16 Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
01 16 Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
01 16 Oohh...
01 16 Are you kidding? I can't DO the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!
01 16 [group of workers awing at Rarity]
01 16  Of course! Why wouldn't I be ok? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
01 16 WHAT?!
01 16 [workers continue awing at Rarity]
01 16 What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now...
01 16 [crowd cheering]
01 16 EYAH!
01 16 Umm...
01 16 She's talking to you!
01 16 Uhh... What am I gonna do?
01 16 [Scared babble]
01 16  C'mon Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one.
01 16 [crowd cheering]
01 16 Oof. WAAAH!
01 16 Time for phase two.
01 16 Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic  rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now!
01 16 [crowd gasps]
01 16 
01 16 Hold on Rarity! I'm coming!
01 16 
01 16 Whoa.
01 16 [crowd cheering]
01 16 I did it. I did it!
01 16 Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day EVER!
01 16 Aw, it's ok. Everything turned out alright, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.
01 16  OhmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohMYGOSH!
01 16 OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
01 16 Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
01 16 This really is the best day EVER!
01 16 Heh, thanks guys.
01 16 Aww, that's ok. Don't worry about it.
01 16 Sorry boys... But I've got plans!
01 16 [end credits]
01 19 Yeah. Cause all you said earlier was...
01 19 We'll see about that.
01 19 Get 'em!
01 19 Come on!
01 19 Twilight!
01 19 That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
01 19 She must be in there. Let's go!
01 19 Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
01 21 Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
01 21 Ghk...
01 21 Awwww!
01 21  Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?
01 21  If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?
01 21  When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?
01 21 [whispering and sarcasm] ... No, Fluttershy.
01 21  I do not think she's a tree! I was just –
01 21  No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly –
01 21 Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act.
01 21 Hey there!
01 21 Where ya headed in such a hurry?
01 21 Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky... No offense.
01 21 I just wanna know – Hey!
01 21 I'm talking to you – Whoa...
01 21 Arrgggg... I got you now, you – 
01 21 Ugggh..
01 21 Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...
01 21 Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
01 21 Yah! … Pinkie Pie!
01 21 Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
01 21 You're gonna blow my cover.
01 21 I'm trying to save Spike!
01 21 And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... Caught.
01 21 Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!
01 21  Ugh...
01 21 Huh.. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still –
01 21 You!
01 21 That's it! We are outta here!
01 21 Yeah, right.
01 21 Huh?
01 21 Hmph...
01 21 Huh-ah.. I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosians to talk to!
01 21 We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
01 21 We brought our new pal, Little Strongheart here, to explain to the Appleloosians why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
01 21 The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
01 21 Plant the trees somewhere else!
01 21 The BUFFALO had it FIRST!
01 21 Come ON Applejack!
01 21 [At the same time] >Applejack
01 21 You're bein' unreasonable! >Rainbow Dash
01 21 I put my hoof down!
01 21 I know you don't want to do this.
01 21 I don't know... But it's never too late to think of something.
01 21 Come on, THINK. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!
01 21  He's not gonna do it!
01 21 [Pinkie Pie]
01 21 –whaddaya say?
01 21 You got to share
01 21 You got to care
01 21 It's the right thing to do
01 22 So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?  Is the pay good?  Hellooo! Anybody home?
01 22 Ooh, you're good.  Too good. I'm bored.
01 22 What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? 1 2 3 GO!
01 22 [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!
01 22 [royal guards laugh]
01 22 Yeah!
01 22 [everypony laughs]
01 22 <a href="/wiki/Credits" title="Credits">credits</a>
01 23 I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story?
01 23 It all happened during the race at Flight Camp, where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor. I've never flown like THAT before. That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt. The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it a lot.
01 23 Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning! Most people thought that the Sonic Rainboom was just an old mare's tail. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!
01 23 And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
01 24 Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
01 24 Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?
01 24 He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
01 25 Nice one! Now, let me show you how it’s really done.
01 25 Hey, Pinkie Pie!
01 25 Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!
01 25  What kind of surprises?
01 25 See ya later, birthday alligator!
01 25 This afternoon?
01 25 Oh, man! We’d love to, but… we’re… house-sitting this afternoon.
01 25 Uh, look at the time! We’d really better get going.
01 25 Harry.
01 25 Yeah, I don’t think you know him.
01 25 Yup! He’s a bear all right, and he’ll be pretty upset if we don’t get over to his house soon.
01 25 But he’s fixed up the place so much it feels like a house.
01 25 A-at the beach!
01 25 Yup! He loves to...
01 25 [over Fluttershy] Play beach volleyball! ...Collect sea shells! ...Play sea shells!
01 25 Gotta go!
01 25 Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!
01 25 Phew…
01 25 Ah!
01 25 
01 25 
01 25 Applejack! We have a problem!
01 25  You heard her! Construction!
01 25 [ponies mimicking noises of various construction tools]
01 25 Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn’t slow down and say, “Hello.” You know how it goes.
01 25 Yeah… so, why don’t you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
01 25 Uh… Pinkie Pie?
01 25 Aaallrighty. What do you say we get out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack’s…
01 25 You should really just come with me.
01 25 Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh… That’s it. Party’s over. Come on, Pinkie Pie!
01 25 Pinkie Pie, let’s go!
01 25 You…  have to… come with… me!
01 25 Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We’ll do this the hard way!
01 25  We're... here...
01 25 Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
01 25 Uh-huh! It sure would.
01 25 I’m just glad I haven’t been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
01 25 You don’t wanna know.
01 25 For Gummy, yeah!
01 26 For what?
01 26 Sure thing, Spike.
01 26 Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
01 26 Been dreaming, I've been waiting
01 26 To fly with those brave ponies
01 26 The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks
01 26 Spinning 'round and having kicks
01 26 Perform for crowds of thousands
01 26 They'll shower us with diamonds
01 26 The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala!
01 26 As a Wonderbolt is
01 26 To prove!
01 26 Hey, no prob.
01 26 Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
01 26 Sure. Why not? I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts! [squee, giggle]
01 26 Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to Soarin'] You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome!
01 26 This isn't hanging out.
01 26 If it's the last thing I do...
01 26 Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.
01 26 This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
01 26 Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
02 01 Come back here you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this?... Cotton candy? Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just– you did. Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!
02 01 There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
02 01 All right, Princess!
02 01 Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
02 01 That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
02 01 Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
02 01 The first rule?
02 01 Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
02 01 Moving out!
02 01 I've got you now, element.
02 01 Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
02 01 I've got a message for you, too!
02 01 Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
02 02 Hey guys!
02 02 That's nice.
02 02 Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
02 02 Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine.
02 02 Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone!
02 02 Wh-what happened?  How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
02 03 [assorted grunting and hi-yah noises]
02 03 Uh, what are you talking about?
02 03 I don't have any issues with Applejack.
02 03 ...because she asked me to. Right Applejack?
02 03 You got it, boss.
02 03 
02 03 [various shock statements]
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 [sighs of relief]
02 03 
02 03 Canterlot?
02 03 Wait!
02 03 ...but we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
02 03 Mmhmm.
02 03 [All right, etc]
02 03 
02 03 Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
02 03 
02 04 [laughing maniacally]
02 04 Lighten up, old-timer. It's the best night of the year for pranks!
02 04 It's all in good fun. OH OH, there's another group over there!
02 04 
02 04 
02 06 
02 07 Haha! Woohoo! Yeah!  Woah!
02 07 Who? Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious. C'mon, try and keep up! 
02 07 Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
02 07  Whaa!
02 07 Phew.
02 07 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 07 What are you all doing out here?
02 07 Uh, you do?
02 07 Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?
02 07 Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!
02 07 I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules
02 07 It's of utmost importance
02 07 The pet that I get
02 07 Is something that's awesome and cool
02 07 I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
02 07 Cutesy, wootsie? Have you even met me?
02 07 Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
02 07 Pass.
02 07 Otters and seals do not fly.
02 07 That's it. I'm outta here.
02 07 Bigger. And cooler.
02 07 It's just a squirrel.
02 07 ...Yeah. So, like I was saying...
02 07 Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it
02 07 I need a pet to keep up with me
02 07 Something awesome, something flying
02 07 With coolness that defies gravity!
02 07 Ya think?
02 07 Better, but cooler.
02 07 Now you're talking. But instead of just one standout, now that's too many.
02 07 So many choices, and such riches aplenty
02 07 The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too
02 07 Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?
02 07 What to do, what to do? 
02 07 A prize! That's it! There's really just one way
02 07 To find out which animal's best
02 07 Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts
02 07 That will put each pet to the test
02 07 Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
02 07 Just like me
02 07 Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best
02 07 So a contest we will see
02 07 Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet
02 07 In the world for me
02 07 Begin
02 07 And may the best pet win!
02 07 [blows whistle]
02 07 [whistle blow] Shh! [to assembled animals] So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?
02 07 Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?
02 07 No.
02 07 Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!
02 07 But--
02 07 Grrgh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed, agility, guts, style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness.
02 07 You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
02 07 Speed! On your marks...
02 07 Get set... [blows whistle] Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
02 07 Yeah! That's speed!
02 07 [to the tortoise] That's just sad.
02 07 Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
02 07 Yeah baby, now that's what I call agility! Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
02 07 Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
02 07 Now that takes guts!
02 07 Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
02 07 Coolness!
02 07 [owl hoots]
02 07 Sorta cool.
02 07 [duck quacks]
02 07 Not cool.
02 07 [bat cries]
02 07 Pretty cool.
02 07 [toucan cries]
02 07 Could be cooler.
02 07 [wasp buzzing]
02 07 Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you!
02 07 [tortoise coughs]
02 07 Eugh.
02 07 [eagle cries]
02 07 Now that's a cool sound!
02 07 [to bat] Sorta awesome. [to toucan] Not awesome. [to flamingo] Could be more awesome. [to owl] Hohoho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?
02 07 [bat plays theme song, squeals and glasses shatter]
02 07 Whoa! That was truly awesome! But... I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.  Listen, turtle...
02 07 Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.
02 07 [turtle croaks]
02 07 You didn't.
02 07 I mean... A for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final, tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect ...a race against me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!
02 07 [eagle cries]
02 07 Gesundheit.
02 07 ["Ride of the Valkyries" plays]
02 07 Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so, obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor, and glory, of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo!
02 07 Woohoo! Haha! Try to keep up!
02 07 Can't catch me, ha ha!
02 07 
02 07 C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?
02 07 Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa.
02 07 Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right guys?
02 07 AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa!
02 07 C'mon... no! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!
02 07 Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha- You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!
02 07 Just my pride.
02 07 Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
02 07 Oh... right... yeah. That.
02 07 Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does looks cool... he's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet. 
02 07 But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
02 07 And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me, was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
02 07 [falcon cry]
02 07 Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia, I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.
02 07 Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.
02 07 Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
02 07 Hmm...
02 07 Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
02 07 
02 08 [ponies chattering]
02 08 What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
02 08 [ponies agreeing]
02 08 
02 08 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 08  What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
02 08 Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks everypony. It was really no big deal.
02 08  Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
02 08 [crowd gasps]
02 08 She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 [cameras clicking]
02 08 Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
02 08 [old ponies screaming]
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 I can't hear you!
02 08 And then, I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
02 08 Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
02 08 Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
02 08 ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?
02 08 This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.
02 08  There you go.
02 08 Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
02 08  Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
02 08 Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
02 08 [ponies screaming]
02 08 [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow-
02 08 Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa!
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
02 08 [jackhammer and drills]
02 08 Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor- whoa!
02 08 [building creaking]
02 08 Never fear-uh-I'm coming- Hold on- whoa!
02 08 Here ya go, safe and sound.
02 08 
02 08 Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare-Do-Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
02 08  Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.
02 08 [water rushing]
02 08  If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.
02 08 [stone cracking]
02 08 My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself-   Help!  Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank- You gotta be kidding me...
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 Oh, for the love of pete.
02 08 
02 08 I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
02 08 I didn't say that.
02 08 Who, me?
02 08 Don't write that, Spike!
02 08 [others laughing]
02 08 Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good- no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!
02 08 Huh, no sign of trouble here, darnit.
02 08 Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
02 08 Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?  Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here.
02 08 You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!
02 08 Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
02 08  Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
02 08  Somepony's in trouble!
02 08 You'd better let me open this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
02 08 [clicks neck] 
02 08 Ta-da!
02 08 How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
02 08 Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?
02 08 Oh look!
02 08 [lawnmower rattling]
02 08 Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
02 08 From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
02 08 Aww, who am I kidding?
02 08 [thundercloud rumbles throughout]
02 08 All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this, and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.
02 08 I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.
02 08 Wait a minute. Why are you here?
02 08 No! No way! Can't you see I- I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
02 08 Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.  Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e-  Hey squirt! Wait up!
02 08 The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
02 08 [ponies gasp]
02 08 So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
02 08 What the hay?
02 08 Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved!  P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?
02 08 I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
02 08 Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
02 08 Okay, a lot.
02 08 Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
02 08 That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
02 08 Okay, let's hear it.
02 08 Look out! It's a real ghost!
02 09 How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
02 09 Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
02 09 Duh, the one in your mouth!
02 09 Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!
02 10 Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
02 10 Huh?  Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
02 10 Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
02 10 That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
02 10 Put her down, right now!
02 10 I mean it, dragon boy!
02 10 Drop her, scaly!
02 10 
02 10 
02 10 Look! The Wonderbolts!
02 10 On it!
02 10 [wind rushing]
02 10 All in a day's work.
02 11 I can hardly wait!
02 11 Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.
02 11 I spy a snowpony!
02 11 Aaah, Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!
02 11 Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
02 11 
02 11 All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!?
02 11 For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!
02 11 What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.
02 11 You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!
02 11 Well, I'm leaving first!
02 11 
02 11 Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?
02 11 Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!
02 11 We must find a new land!
02 11 C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!
02 11 [lightning cracks]
02 11 Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!
02 11 You never know where enemies might be lurking.
02 11 A-ha! What's that?! [fighting noises]
02 11 Okay. This is getting old.
02 11 This is the new land we've been searching for!
02 11 I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!
02 11 We found our new home!
02 11 I planted my flag first!
02 11 Did too!
02 11 The name is Pegasopolis!
02 11 Pegasopolis!
02 11 I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win!
02 11 [wind blows]
02 11 I'll have you court-martialled for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield!
02 11 
02 11 
02 11 Oh no. Not again.
02 11 [wind blowing]
02 11 It's Commander Hurricane.
02 11 You mean like this, your highness?
02 11 Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!
02 11 What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!
02 11  I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
02 11 Hey! You invaded our territory!
02 11 That's the last straw!
02 11 [arguing over rock]
02 11 Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!
02 11 You've been fighting too, your highness.
02 11 That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls!
02 11 Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
02 11 Y'know what? I got it.
02 13 Aw yeah, heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake gets there his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
02 13 I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash!
02 14 Huh? Now, <span title="&quot;be careful&quot; in the updated iTunes rerelease and just &quot;careful&quot; on subsequent television airings" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">careful, Derpy</span>! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
02 14 
02 14 Yeah. It's a mystery.
02 14 
02 14 No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
02 14 [wood splintering]
02 14 Seeya in a week!
02 14 Well, that is the point.
02 14 What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
02 14 So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!
02 14 I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
02 14 Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
02 14 “Change of scenery”? What's that supposed to mean?
02 14 Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!
02 14 Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
02 14 Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
02 14 [gears turning]
02 14 Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
02 14 Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
02 14 Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
02 14 That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
02 14 It's time to call in the big guns.
02 14 [five thumps]
02 14 The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans.
02 14 Tomorrow, huh? I don't know...
02 14 Yeah, maybe.
02 14 Pull over!
02 14 Come on, Fluttershy!
02 14 No time! They knew what they were getting into!
02 14 Not so fast!
02 14 
02 14 But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
02 14 And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
02 14 Nn-nn.
02 14 Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
02 15 C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!
02 15 The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
02 15 Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line and then they always run out of cider!
02 15 Well not this year! This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want, and laugh when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her- 
02 15 Who are all these ponies?!
02 15 
02 15 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 15 
02 15 Surprise surprise. You ran out again!
02 15 Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
02 15 
02 15 
02 15 [motorized noises]
02 15 I doubt that.
02 15 Oh for Pete's sake!
02 15 Is this some kind of cruel joke?
02 15 Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
02 15 In my sleep!
02 15 We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
02 15 Applejack, help me!
02 15 All right then, double time!
02 15 I ought to press you into jerk cider!
02 16 Awwww.
02 16 Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!
02 16 You guys have gotta get me out of here, I'm gonna climb the walls!
02 16 Few days? Might as well be a few months, or few years!
02 16 What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
02 16 No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
02 16 ...to get to the other side! Get it? Nevermind...
02 16 [clock ticking]
02 16 [growls in frustration] 
02 16 [Dash's head banging on bed]
02 16   As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years! Huh. I'm right there with you, sister.
02 16 The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step.
02 16 [various big cats growling and roaring]
02 16 [kitten mewing]
02 16 [steadily getting more excited] Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!
02 16 I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I- I love reading! I'm an egghead.
02 16 The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple.
02 16 [beetles scuttling]
02 16 
02 16 [various noises: metal hitting stone, fire whooshing, alligators snapping, shing, etc]
02 16 
02 16 Uh, hey, guys...
02 16 [short nervous laugh] No no, you first.
02 16 Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again!
02 16 Whoaa, you found my seagull.
02 16 [seagull crying]
02 16 You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud. You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose. [makes horse noise]
02 16 You win some, you lose some.
02 16  Thanks for coming!
02 16 Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading.  It's nap time for me! [mocks snoring]
02 16 
02 16 Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber.
02 16 At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!
02 16 [stone clinking]
02 16 [arrows firing]
02 16 Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but-
02 16 Oh, just in time. I am soo hungry.
02 16 [makes exaggerated eating noises]
02 16  ”You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.”
02 16 Whoa! Who is this dude?
02 16 H- oh, good evening-
02 16 -morning. Doc.
02 16 Of course not. 
02 16 What? Later today? [biting hoof]
02 16 Right now?! 'Right now' right now?
02 16 But I don't feel better!
02 16 How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!
02 16 Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all... Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
02 16 Owww... [grunts in pain unrealistically] Oh, the pain... the pain!
02 16 Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there.
02 16 Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
02 16 B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!
02 16 What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing...
02 16 [owl hoots]
02 16 
02 16 [heart monitor beeping]
02 16 I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!
02 16 
02 16  I'm an egghead.
02 16 See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of-
02 16 You got me.
02 16 Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it.
02 16 Oh, thanks Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
02 16 Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
02 16 [to Spike] Didja get all that?
02 16 Great! You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book! 
02 16 And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured...
02 16 ...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do! [sighs in admiration] Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet... Awesome!
02 16 
02 17 [indistinct chatter]
02 17 [school bell ringing]
02 18 Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
02 20 You got it!
02 20 And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
02 20 Hey, Twilight, another pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and-  What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?
02 20  Oh, this is too rich.  Hey Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!
02 20 
02 20 Oh no!
02 20 Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a-
02 20 Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
02 21 Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!
02 21 Yeaagh! Ugh!
02 21 Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.
02 21 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 21 Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?
02 21 Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?
02 21 [dragon roaring]
02 21  Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind.
02 21  Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!
02 21 
02 21 One tough stain against one lame dragon. 
02 21 Hey guys!
02 21 Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
02 21 What?!?
02 21 Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary...
02 21 All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
02 21 Aaagh!
02 21 Don't tell me you think he should go?
02 21 I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.
02 21 [under her breath] Rrgh.
02 21 Yeah, we hope your trip-
02 21 - your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?" questions.
02 21 Go get 'em, big guy!
02 21 I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
02 21 We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!
02 21 [strained noise]
02 21 Not so fast!
02 21 Forever?!
02 21 I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
02 21 Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!
02 21 I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!
02 21 Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
02 21 
02 22 Calling all pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
02 22 Library, tonight. Be cool, or be mule. No offense.
02 22 Alright, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go.
02 22 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 22 [old film projector running up]
02 22 [old music begins playing]
02 22 So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.
02 22 Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
02 22 ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.
02 22 That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?
02 22 Are we gonna be strong?
02 22 Are we gonna be fast?
02 22 Record-smashing fast?
02 22 Who's with me?
02 22 Fluttershy!
02 22 Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
02 22 Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy.
02 22  Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open-
02 22 Fluttershy, what happened to you?
02 22 Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
02 22 Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
02 22 [blows whistle]
02 22 Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?
02 22 What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
02 22 It wasn't that bad.
02 22 Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for- I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get.
02 22  Thanks anyway.
02 22 You will?
02 22 You're game?
02 22 Alright!
02 22 Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?
02 22 Not bad...not bad. [joints cracking] [revving sounds]
02 22 Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!
02 22 Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn. [blows whistle]
02 22 [hushed, to Twilight Sparkle] No, you tell her!
02 22 Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5.
02 22 Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
02 22 But I need you!
02 22 This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
02 22 [squirrel chittering]
02 22 You did awesome, Fluttershy.
02 22 So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
02 22 Well, uh... I'd feel... um...
02 22  If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
02 22 [ponies cheering]
02 22 Are we ready to do this?
02 22 Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
02 22 Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
02 22 Phew!
02 22 No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!
02 22 Yaa- oof!
02 22  I'm fine!
02 22 Rbbbb- We've got to try again!
02 22 
02 22 No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
02 22 Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
02 22 C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
02 22 Whoa, girl, take it easy!
02 22 Yeah, we did it! You did it!
02 22 Ah!
02 22 Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!
02 23 You guys!
02 23 The new Gabby Gums just came out! “The Great and Powerful Trixie's secrets revealed!”
02 23  Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.
02 23 Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
02 23 It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof.
02 23 
02 23  Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me.
02 23  Well, my life is officially over. Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.
02 23 I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late!  I'm a laughing stock!
02 23 Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums.
02 23 Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
02 23 
02 23 [rain falling]
02 24  I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
02 24 So...
02 24 Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed.
02 24 What happened?
02 24 I-I don't even like cake!
02 24 I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!
02 24 Ow! Cut it out!
02 24 Aw nuts, so did I.
02 24 And boy was it!
02 24 Yeah, I just dove right in!
02 24 Sorry Pinkie.
02 25 
02 25 Yes!
02 25 A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say “best wedding ever”!
02 25 Whoa, what's with all the guards?
02 25 Sorry Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
02 25 You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
02 26 Rarity!
02 26 Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
02 26 Best - wedding - ever!
03 01 Crystal what?
03 01 A way to protect the empire! You know anything about it or what?
03 01 Hold on! You gotta know something!
03 01 It says that they liked jousting
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
03 01 Let's do this!
