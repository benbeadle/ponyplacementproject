01 01 Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
01 09 Did you see her Twilight? Did you see... Zecora?
01 09 [shakily] Did not!
01 09 I walked here myself!
01 09 Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself!
01 09 Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.
01 09 Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?
01 09 [under breath] I am a big pony!
01 09 Well I'm brave enough; I'm gonna find out myself. [gasps]
01 09 [gulps]
01 09 [gasp]
01 09 I...I...
01 09 This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this.
01 09 No.
01 09 Hehehe. Sorry Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.
01 09 Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?
01 09 Why wouldn't I be?
01 09 [laughs]
01 09 Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.
01 09 This isn't a curse.
01 09 It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
01 09 Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!
01 09 Hahaha.
01 09 But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed.
01 09 Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!
01 09 [Ponies gasping and screaming in fright]
01 12 What!
01 12 [Apple Bloom takes a note from Diamond Tiara]
01 12 Uh I... Um...
01 12 [declining the offer] m-mm.
01 12 No...
01 12 It's not fair! It's just not fair!
01 12 But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera without one, I just can't!
01 12 I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family. ...runs in the family. Runs in the family! Runs in the family! You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples! Apples apples apples! [crash] Oops... apples.
01 12 Delicious and nutritious, and so many uses! You can eat 'em, play with 'em, [groan] [offscreen: hey, watch it!] create fine art for your home with 'em, you have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
01 12 You sir, care t' buy some apples?
01 12 Why not?
01 12 Are you sure?
01 12 You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?
01 12 Aaal-right!
01 12 Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shopp'n bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. YOU TOUCH IT, YOU BUY IT. We take cash or credit.
01 12 That'll be four bits.
01 12 Likely story. Four bits, lady!
01 12 What?
01 12 What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?
01 12 Hm.
01 12 Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
01 12 Mmm-hmm.
01 12 You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'till the end of th' market?
01 12 So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark.
01 12 [gasp]
01 12 Yeah, pretty... sweet.
01 12 There's a cute-ceañera this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!
01 12 Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.
01 12 But Applejack says th...
01 12 I'm ready!
01 12 I'M READY!
01 12 Ah!
01 12 Whoa!
01 12 Hai-ya! Ee...
01 12 Whoaaa! Whoa...
01 12 I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at.
01 12 Eatin' cupcakes?
01 12 I really appreciate all your help Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I c'n learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at cute-ceañera! Hold on Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'.
01 12 I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!
01 12 Oh.
01 12 I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too.
01 12 [cough] Hot, hot, hot!
01 12 Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either. [sigh] I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.
01 12 What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there? [gasp] A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe.
01 12 Twilight, you have to help me.
01 12 Tiara's cute-ceañera's today and everypony in my class will be there and they all have cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, RIIIGHT NOW!
01 12 You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.
01 12 Please Twilight, jus' trah.
01 12 Oh please, please, please please please!
01 12 Oh thank you thank you thank you. [pwing] Yes! I knew you could do... it.
01 12 Try again, try again!
01 12 [gasp]
01 12 It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me name. It will be the worst night of my life.
01 12 Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that [gulp] party.
01 12 [ponies chatter]
01 12 How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugar Cube corner?
01 12 I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.
01 12 Okay Apple Bloom, almost there.
01 12 [grunt]
01 12 Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.
01 12 Uh, I have a cutie mark.
01 12 Since... Um... Earlier today.
01 12 I shouldn't, I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-ceañera, can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?
01 12 Okay, well, Imma go mingle. Enjoy your party. [sigh]
01 12 [record scratch]
01 12 [everyone gasps]
01 12 Oh no.
01 12 You don't have cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one.
01 12 Apple Bloom.
01 12 [music]
01 12 So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?
01 12 Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?
01 12 A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.
01 12 How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
01 12 We're gonna be unstoppable!
01 12 NOT the cupcakes. Trust me.
01 12 Yeah! Come on.
01 13 Woohoo!
01 17 Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!
01 17 Hey, Sweetie Belle!
01 17 Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.
01 17 I'm ready! You ready?
01 17 Oh, wow! [laughter, gasps] That's so cool! Oooh!
01 17 To find our cutie marks!
01 17 Oooooh!
01 17 I am!
01 17 Me too!
01 17 And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!
01 17 Yeah!
01 17 I guess we aren't creature catchers.
01 17 I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!
01 17 Hammer!
01 17 Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
01 17 A game?
01 17 Me three!
01 17 Okay, now what can we do? Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?
01 17 Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusading to do!
01 17 How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
01 17 Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!
01 17 Good night, Fluttershy!
01 17 There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.
01 17 Well, we have to think of something. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!
01 17 Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, brawck brawck brawck, brawck!
01 17 Calling for the chicken!
01 17 Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?
01 17 Then show me.
01 17 You're just chicken!
01 17 Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!
01 17 You also forgot how to call a chicken.
01 17 [blows a raspberry]
01 17 Maybe that's our special talent. Arguing!
01 17 Is too!
01 17 Is too! Anything yet?
01 17 Darn.
01 17 [giggle]
01 17 [wind blows]
01 17 Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, bwock, bwock bwock bwock bwock bwock b-bwooock!
01 17 [wind blowing]
01 17 Is too!
01 17 Is too!
01 17 Fluttershy, what--
01 17 A cocka what now?
01 17 Well, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.
01 17 The chicken!
01 17 I thought only one escaped!
01 17 Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
01 17 Yes, Fluttershy.
01 18 Where are you takin' us?
01 18 Oh. Sorry.
01 18 What are we lookin' at?
01 18 Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?
01 18 Whoa! Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter.
01 18 Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...
01 18 There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice.
01 18 COOL!
01 18 Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...
01 18 We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.
01 18 We'll leave no stone unturned!
01 18 No sock unworn!
01 18 Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians.
01 18 "Showcase your talents...
01 18 This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'!
01 18 Square dancin'!
01 18 Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...
01 18 What do we need this fan for?
01 18 I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
01 18 And mind-blowin' dance moves.
01 18 Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.
01 18 And Scootaloo, you're great in manoeuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves.
01 18 Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hai-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah!
01 18 One... two... three... Oh! Oh!
01 18 Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right.
01 18 Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!
01 18 Will do.
01 18 Ouch!
01 18 I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. [looks at Sweetie Belle's work] You know, ponies only have four legs.
01 18 Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places.
01 18 Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.
01 18 You're not using power tools, are you?
01 18 Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
01 18 I think that sounded pretty good.
01 18 Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?
01 18 Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
01 18 And I'm the main dancer. Hai-ya!
01 18 Ugh!
01 18 I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
01 18 They'll just laugh some more.
01 18 Can you believe it? We won!
01 18 But we think we know why.
01 18 We each should be embracing our true talent!
01 23 See anything?
01 23 This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?
01 23 Applejack!
01 23 Pinkie Pie?
01 23 Fluttershy?
01 23 Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.
01 23 YEAH!
01 23 Thievin' what now?
01 23 [crash]
01 23 Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
01 23 We need all the help we can get.
01 23 Okay, okay.
01 23 Look! We're here!
01 23 Awwww...
02 01 Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'.
02 01 It's got an eagle claw.
02 01 Confusion!
02 01 You're both wrong!
02 01 It's confusion!
02 03 [giggling]
02 03 Oh, hi Twilight. How's it go--
02 03 Yeah. Great.
02 03 Yeah... great.
02 03 Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much.
02 03 Applejack says it's important to share.
02 03 I need it.
02 03 [arguing, continues]
02 03 No way!
02 03 Give her back!
02 03 [don't touch it, it's mine, etc]
02 05 How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?
02 05 Huh?
02 05 The Sisterhoof Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!
02 05 Yeah! Uncouth? [belches] Wait. What's uncouth?
02 05 [mouth full of apple] What's uncouth?
02 05 [belches]
02 05 [laughing]
02 05 [more laughing]
02 05 It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?
02 05 That's why we do it...
02 05 Together!
02 05 Well, that's silly!
02 05 Whoa! [laughing]
02 05 That tickles! [laughing].
02 05 Got it, sis!
02 05 Yee-haw!
02 05 What?!
02 05 Besides, she's my big sister!
02 05 We're still sisters, right?
02 05 Look at the size of that pig!
02 05 You do now!
02 05 I'd like you to borrow my sis so you can give it a try!
02 05 One. Day. One. Day.
02 05 One. Day. Good luck!
02 05 Ooh, so close! You almost won!
02 05 But you finished together!
02 05 Mm-hmm.
02 05 Yeah!
02 05 [laughing]
02 06 Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'!
02 06 Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes!
02 06 Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins?
02 06 Okay then... Um... the Bowling Dolls!
02 06 All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!
02 06 Phpoo!
02 06 [ponies cheering]
02 06 I did it! I did it! Blank?
02 06 [more cheering]
02 06 But... but... what about my ball?
02 06 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 06 No, it won't.
02 06 (kazoos blow)
02 06 No, it won't.
02 06 No, it won't.
02 06 Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn...
02 06 Ow...
02 06 [with a lisp] I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!
02 06 [with a lisp] Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!
02 06 [glug, glug] Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...
02 06 And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything.
02 06 Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?
02 06 Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?
02 06 Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?
02 06 Yeah, you go, you go.
02 06 Nope, it's a loop-de-hoop!
02 06 A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who knew that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent!
02 06 Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
02 06 [fillies cheering]
02 06 Thanks, everypony!
02 06 [bell rings]
02 06 Yes, Miss Cheerilee?
02 06 Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!
02 06 Great job, girls!
02 06 Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bump! Hoop and hop! [muffled] Hoop and skip! [normal] And hoop and flip!
02 06 [fillies cheering]
02 06 Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?
02 06 I call this one the hoop-la! [makes helicopter noises] Huh? Oof!
02 06 What? No they're not!
02 06 Aw yeah!
02 06 Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?
02 06 [ponies cheering]
02 06 Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!
02 06 Help me! Help me!
02 06 I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!
02 06 Cutie pox?!
02 06 Just like me!
02 06 No known cure?!
02 06 Oh no! Sacrebleu&#160;! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasps] Qu'est-ce c'est?! Je parle français?!
02 06 Oh no! Darn it! More cutie marks! [gasps] What's this?! I speak French?!
02 06 Tout de suite!
02 06 Now
02 06 Dépêchez-vous!
02 06 Hurry
02 06 [accordion playing]
02 06 [lions roaring]
02 06 I, um...
02 06 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
02 06 Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!
02 06 [chomps, chews and swallows] Ahh.
02 06 I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. I- I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again.
02 06 I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?
02 06 Dear Princess Celestia, waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself, and others. And that's something every heart desires.
02 06 Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough.
02 06 So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?
02 06 Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!
02 10 Get away from her, you brute!
02 12 Yay, the zap apples are comin'!
02 12 Ready, Granny!
02 12 For makin' zap apple jam!
02 12 Yes ma'am. I can't wait ma'am!
02 12 To make zap apple jam with you!
02 12 Uh, is this one of your gazillion secret herbal ingredients for the zap apple jam?
02 12 Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years!
02 12 Uh- what do ya mean?
02 12 Granny said that the water needs-
02 12 “Silly ways”?
02 12 [gong crashing]
02 12 Granny, isn't there a less... silly way to get the honey? [gasps]
02 12 Please stop!
02 12 Shh! Stop it, Granny!
02 12 Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me!
02 12 Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast.
02 12 But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak.
02 12 Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't-
02 12 Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville!
02 12 I know... after the fifth day the zap apples disappear...
02 12 [wind blows]
02 12 [crows cawing]
02 12 I know. That's what I'm worried about.
02 12 I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliate-
02 12 But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick!
02 12 Aaah! [muffled] Hey, this is hot!
02 12 Now what?
02 12 It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out!
02 12 That's the fourth sign!
02 12 [electricity crackling]
02 12 The zap apples have appeared!
02 12 They don't look... quite ripe.
02 12 I don't know... zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.
02 12 [electricity crackling]
02 12 Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em!
02 12 Any other bright ideas?
02 12 [knocking]
02 12 [sighs] I can't believe she woke up from her nap. She never wakes up from her nap! [muffled] I wish I could just run off and hide!
02 12 And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag!
02 12 [slaps]
02 12 [sighs] That train ride takes all day. I'm safe, hah.
02 12 Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergency-
02 12 Whuh- what are you doing here? Did you miss the train?
02 12 [to Diamond Tiara] If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains.
02 12 She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!
02 12 I am?
02 12 Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.
02 12 [laughing]
02 12 [credits]
02 14 Whoo-whoa! Whoo-hoo! Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!
02 14 Hope so? I know so! After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champion of Ponyville! Why, you got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever! And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champion.
02 14 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 14 With lots of new blue ribbons!
02 14 Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say?
02 14 Applejack's... not comin' back?
02 14 And she loves her family!
02 14 Y'all are the best.
02 15 You got a deal!
02 15 But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!
02 15 Dea-
02 15 What?
02 15 [clinking of bits]
02 15 [tap clunking]
02 15 That's it! Last cup!
02 15 C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!
02 15 We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!
02 15 Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!
02 15 Anywhere, anytime!
02 15 We'll do it in 45 minutes!
02 15 And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.
02 15 I'll bet you those guys don't even have-
02 15 [gasps]
02 15 What?!
02 15 [machine noises from Cider Squeezy 6000]
02 15 Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind!
02 15 Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!
02 15 Wh, wh-
02 15 Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town!
02 17 Hmm... I just don't feel like it's quite finished.
02 17 A few more hoof-prints.
02 17 Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school.
02 17 We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Day–
02 17 Ever!
02 17 Really?
02 17 If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her.
02 17 Uh, you alright?
02 17 That is the best idea ever.
02 17 So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already.
02 17 This guy's too silly.
02 17 He's way too uptight.
02 17 He's much too flashy.
02 17 If he weren't so splashy.
02 17 Too short.
02 17 Too clean.
02 17 [sigh]
02 17 I don't think that we're mistaken.
02 17 It seems all the good ones are taken.
02 17 Don't wanna quit and give up hope.
02 17 [gasp]
02 17 Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. Are you talking about my brother?
02 17 Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.
02 17 Huh?
02 17 So? What are we waiting for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date.
02 17 [>Apple Bloom, >Scootaloo, and >Sweetie Belle cheer]
02 17 Oops. I'm on it!
02 17 Hi Miss Cheerilee.
02 17 Is it?
02 17 [>Apple Bloom, >Scootaloo, and >Sweetie Belle giggle]
02 17 Oh, sorry big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?
02 17 I guess we'll just be going then.
02 17 [gramophone playing]
02 17 Oh come on Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony.
02 17 [sigh] Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?
02 17 [sigh] There's gotta be something else we could–UGH!
02 17 Aw it's okay Twilight. It was an accident.
02 17 Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know.
02 17 I feel kind of bad tricking my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way.
02 17 Right!
02 17 Hiya, Miss Cheerilee.
02 17 Yup.
02 17 [giggling] They're about to be in for a big surprise.
02 17 [sing-song voice] He's her special somepony. She's his special somepony.
02 17 Aww.
02 17 Did he just say–
02 17 Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?
02 17 What have we done?! My brother's acting like a grade-A goofball.
02 17 Whaddaya mean "uh oh"?!
02 17 What?!
02 17 How "not so well" did things turn out?
02 17 Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spouting nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!
02 17 But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this, oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it, Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starving for apples. Oh it'll be chaos, it'll be chaos!
02 17 [wobbly metallic sheet sounds]
02 17 Well why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panic back there?
02 17 How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?
02 17 Yeah, we noticed.
02 17 [squeaking]
02 17 [vomiting noise] Ugh.
02 17 [squeaking]
02 17 'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your [belch] ugh... shmoopy-doopy-uh-pookie-pie.
02 17 No problem.
02 17 [clock ticking]
02 17 [clock-tower bell chimes]
02 17 No.
02 17 [flapping]
02 17 No.
02 17 [flapping]
02 17 Not that one either.
02 17 [flapping]
02 17 No.
02 17 [flapping]
02 17 Too... Shiny. No. You know, something less... shiny.
02 17 Miss Cheerilee deserves the best.
02 17 How much time is left? I'm running out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.
02 17 [sigh]
02 17 [anxious] Where's my brother?
02 17 [vomit noises]
02 17 [clock-tower bell chimes]
02 17 Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle.
02 17 [wheels creaking]
02 17 Huh–
02 17 [clock-tower bell chimes]
02 17 [gasp]
02 17 Huh?
02 17 [creaking]
02 17 [clock-tower bell chimes]
02 17 He'll get to her! He's too strong!
02 17 One more minute and the spell will be broken!
02 17 Aaaa–
02 17 [smack]
02 17 [clock-tower bell chimes]
02 17 Oh please be normal, please be normal.
02 17 But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.
02 17 But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship.
02 17 We're sorry.
02 17 [sigh]
02 17 Hey there Miss Cheerilee! What are you doing here?
02 17 [gasp]
02 17 NOOO!
02 17 [credits]
02 18 [music starts]
02 23 I've got it! The answer to all our problems!
02 23 [takes deep breath]
02 23 Uh oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!
02 23 [laughs]
02 23 What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!
02 23 Cutie marks in journalism!
02 23 Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.
02 23 [typewriter clicking]
02 23 [ink squirting]
02 23 Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through.
02 23 [camera snapping]
02 23 [sighs] Sorry.
02 23 We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville!
02 23 “Exclusive! Local dragon tells all. Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!”
02 23 [sighs] Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip.
02 23 Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one.
02 23 Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!
02 23 Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you?
02 23 You're not even gonna talk to us?
02 23 This is the worst day ever!
02 23 So what do we do?
02 23 Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.
02 23 All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville. Signing off for the very last time, <span title="Hugs and kisses" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">XOXO</span>, Gabby Gums.
