fluttershy Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean, no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
fluttershy 
fluttershy [very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
fluttershy [even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy  A baby dragon!
fluttershy 
fluttershy Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!
fluttershy Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
fluttershy Wait, wait! What's his name?
fluttershy Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?
fluttershy Absolutely everything.
fluttershy Oh, yes, please!
fluttershy Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
fluttershy Ready?
fluttershy Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
fluttershy Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
fluttershy [animal roar]
fluttershy Wait.
fluttershy Wait.
fluttershy Wait!
fluttershy WAIT!
fluttershy Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
fluttershy Now this might hurt for just a second.
fluttershy  Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are.
fluttershy I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
fluttershy 
fluttershy Why Rarity, it's so lovely.
fluttershy No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
fluttershy 
fluttershy  Angel, these are perfect.
fluttershy Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be alright, if you haven't given it to someone else--
fluttershy Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much The Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!
fluttershy 
fluttershy Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
fluttershy Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea.
fluttershy Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
fluttershy Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
fluttershy Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
fluttershy Twilight?
fluttershy Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
fluttershy Dizzy?
fluttershy Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.
fluttershy Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
fluttershy Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
fluttershy Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
fluttershy Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
fluttershy Oh no.
fluttershy Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.
fluttershy Alright little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.
fluttershy Please excuse me.
fluttershy Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to...
fluttershy B-b-b-but I... I...
fluttershy  
fluttershy Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
fluttershy Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean–
fluttershy I'm a year older than you.
fluttershy  Not too fast now, Angel bunny. You don't wanna get a tummy ache.  You really should eat more than that, don't you think? It's not play time yet. I know you want to run, but... just three more bites. Two more bites? One more bite? Pretty please? 
fluttershy Oh, goodness. Are you okay?
fluttershy Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
fluttershy Because you need some water?
fluttershy  Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy [ponies conversing in the background]
fluttershy Help. Help! Please? Help? There's-- there's a horrible cloud of smoke. It's headed this way and-- aaa!
fluttershy Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for--
fluttershy There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And--
fluttershy We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be--
fluttershy Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need every pony to--
fluttershy That's what I've been trying to--
fluttershy Oh, thank goodness.
fluttershy A... d-dragon?
fluttershy Huh?
fluttershy 
fluttershy Um, actually...
fluttershy 
fluttershy Um, let's... not? 
fluttershy M-m-mountain?
fluttershy  Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but...
fluttershy But if I could just have a second...
fluttershy So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville.
fluttershy Oh! Good. I'll stay here and--
fluttershy I don't think I--
fluttershy I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... But... But... 
fluttershy 
fluttershy But... but...! 
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy 
fluttershy It-- it's so... high!
fluttershy I-it's so... so... steep.
fluttershy Oh... okay. [soft cry]
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy 
fluttershy [soft grunts]
fluttershy 
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy [goat bleat]
fluttershy 
fluttershy But... it's so... wide.
fluttershy I--
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy I don't know.
fluttershy O-okay. Here I go. A hop.
fluttershy Skip.
fluttershy 
fluttershy I guess I forgot to jump.
fluttershy An... an ava... ava...
fluttershy AVALA--!
fluttershy [collective sigh]
fluttershy 
fluttershy  Sorry.
fluttershy  
fluttershy 
fluttershy I-- I-- I can't go in the cave.
fluttershy I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of .
fluttershy I'm scared of .
fluttershy I'm scared of dragons!
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy Yes, because they're not dragons.
fluttershy Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
fluttershy Yes, because he not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy 
fluttershy I was afraid to.
fluttershy I-- I-- I just... can't.
fluttershy How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully. You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?
fluttershy Well?
fluttershy And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
fluttershy Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?
fluttershy There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all.
fluttershy It's okay, Rainbow Dash. Not every pony can be as brave as me. 
fluttershy [goat bleat]
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy She's mysterious.
fluttershy Animals care for themselves...
fluttershy And then, she digs at the ground.
fluttershy What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
fluttershy [Pinkie Pie sings "Evil Enchantress" in the background]
fluttershy The door's open.
fluttershy ... it's a curse.
fluttershy [deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
fluttershy [Spike snorts, then bursts out laughing]
fluttershy Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.
fluttershy Oopsie! Sorry.
fluttershy Uh... Spike? Are you coming?
fluttershy 
fluttershy She's an evil enchantress
fluttershy She does evil dances
fluttershy And if you look deep in her eyes
fluttershy She'll put you in trances
fluttershy Then what will she do?
fluttershy She'll mix up an evil brew
fluttershy Then she'll gobble you up
fluttershy In a big tasty stew
fluttershy Soooo.... Watch out!
fluttershy You made me sound ridiculous!
fluttershy And the chanting?
fluttershy [normal voice] ... Yes.
fluttershy [All ponies laugh]
fluttershy 
fluttershy La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
fluttershy Gah!
fluttershy Hello little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
fluttershy Oh, are you hungry? Here you go.  I guess you were hungry.
fluttershy You're the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to show you to my friends.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
fluttershy You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
fluttershy  Three?
fluttershy I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
fluttershy Pinkie, do you want the other one?
fluttershy Ugh?
fluttershy How could you not like...
fluttershy I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
fluttershy What do we do?
fluttershy Ouch.
fluttershy 
fluttershy Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
fluttershy What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
fluttershy We wake up all their sleepy heads
fluttershy So quietly and nice
fluttershy We welcome back the southern birds
fluttershy So their families can grow!
fluttershy Wake up little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
fluttershy Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.
fluttershy It's like a long sleep.
fluttershy Yes. [bell rings] Wake up little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
fluttershy Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens, I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
fluttershy You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.
fluttershy Good morning friends.
fluttershy Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
fluttershy No, you simply must wait.
fluttershy Stop.
fluttershy Stop.
fluttershy STOP!
fluttershy No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.
fluttershy It's... nice.
fluttershy Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine.
fluttershy Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?
fluttershy I... love it.
fluttershy No, no. I do. It's... nice.
fluttershy Nice.
fluttershy Oh, but I do like it.
fluttershy Um... both?
fluttershy Please stop asking me this, I...
fluttershy No, that's okay...
fluttershy No... it's fine...
fluttershy I... like it...
fluttershy All right! Since you really wanna know...  The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch and the overdesign is reminiscent of pret-a-porter and not true French haute couture.  But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine.
fluttershy French haute couture, please.
fluttershy Making sure we make a good appearance
fluttershy It's... perfect!
fluttershy Uh... panic?
fluttershy Do you like it?
fluttershy Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
fluttershy We just followed your brilliant design.
fluttershy Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.
fluttershy  Bye-bye!
fluttershy Of course.
fluttershy Oh, I'm so sorry.
fluttershy [hydra roars]
fluttershy Ah!
fluttershy [Hydra head laughs]
fluttershy [ponies and Spike screaming]
fluttershy A hop, skip, and a... jump!
fluttershy Loss of control.
fluttershy Screaming and hollering.
fluttershy Passion!
fluttershy [breathes in] Yay.
fluttershy Yay.
fluttershy Yay.
fluttershy [deep breath]  Yaay.
fluttershy ...Too loud?
fluttershy Yay.
fluttershy Wooo.
fluttershy Way to go.
fluttershy Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo.  Did my cheering do that?
fluttershy Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
fluttershy Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
fluttershy Yay.
fluttershy She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.
fluttershy Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom!
fluttershy Then show up at the Cloudseum and see for yourself!.. If you're free.
fluttershy Did you see that? I was so assertive!
fluttershy But Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
fluttershy ... Rare...
fluttershy Rarity?
fluttershy It's incredible!
fluttershy Uhh... C'mon girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!
fluttershy My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
fluttershy Look! Phase two is working. [group starts cheering again]
fluttershy Oh, I can't look!
fluttershy A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! WOOO!
fluttershy A sonic rainboom! Wooo! YEAH!
fluttershy It's ok.
fluttershy Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
fluttershy No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket.
fluttershy Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?
fluttershy 
fluttershy These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?
fluttershy Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
fluttershy What does that patch on your cape mean?
fluttershy I, ah, I suppose I could take them for the night.
fluttershy Oh, it's no problem at all.
fluttershy Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
fluttershy Come on, it'll be fun.
fluttershy These sweet little angels?
fluttershy So cute. W-wait for me!
fluttershy Oh, won't this be ever so fun. We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each other's tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and--
fluttershy [rush of air, clattering hooves]
fluttershy Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?
fluttershy Th-the Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
fluttershy Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
fluttershy What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.
fluttershy [crickets chirping quietly, owl hooting]
fluttershy [door closes]
fluttershy [to herself] No problem at all.  Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?
fluttershy Girls?
fluttershy Should we--
fluttershy Girls, okay, now settle --
fluttershy I-I know you're excited, but-- girls, oh, oh, careful with the-- oh, ah, girls--
fluttershy [Fluttershy moves her mane off her face with a puff]
fluttershy So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?
fluttershy Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?
fluttershy Oh, no. The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
fluttershy Um, oh, maybe that's not such a-- now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring. Dhh--
fluttershy Careful... you don't...
fluttershy 
fluttershy ...break anything.
fluttershy Oh, girls, it's okay. I--
fluttershy C-carpenters?
fluttershy Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
fluttershy It's called "Shhh!"
fluttershy Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun? I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me!  [draws a deep breath]
fluttershy 
fluttershy NO!
fluttershy I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
fluttershy Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?
fluttershy [blows out candle] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
fluttershy How about I sing you a lullaby?
fluttershy [clears throat]
fluttershy Hush now, quiet now
fluttershy It's time to lay your sleepy head
fluttershy Hush now, quiet now
fluttershy It's time to go to bed
fluttershy Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?
fluttershy Okay Sweetie, that was...
fluttershy Thank you Sweetie, um...
fluttershy Okay, Sweetie, that was...
fluttershy Thank you, Sweetie, um...
fluttershy [chickens clucking and flapping]
fluttershy  Girls!
fluttershy No, I don't think that's a-- ah, come back! Please!
fluttershy [Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling, more chicken flapping and squawking]
fluttershy Come on, girls, the chickens are fine-- oh, girls, um... GIRLS!
fluttershy [chickens flapping and clucking]
fluttershy Come on, in you go.
fluttershy [eerie music]
fluttershy There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?
fluttershy Please?
fluttershy So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
fluttershy Okay, good night.
fluttershy  It really wasn't THAT hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids.
fluttershy [quiet galloping]
fluttershy [tearing fabric]
fluttershy Mmm, peace and quiet.  Too quiet.  Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! GIRLS?  Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into...   The Everfree Forest!
fluttershy Those girls have really done it this time! They've really bitten off more than they can chew! Oh, just like me! I never should have offered to watch them. [draws a deep breath]
fluttershy (whispering) Girls?  Girls? [tiny terrified squeak] Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other.
fluttershy [twig snaps]
fluttershy Ahh! What was that?
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy [rush of air, clattering hooves]
fluttershy Twilight? I-is that you? Oh, Twilight, it is you. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're--  Oh! What's happened to you? 
fluttershy [Twilight falls over]
fluttershy Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean-- oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move; I'll be back for you. GIRLS!
fluttershy Girls? Girls?
fluttershy Girls? Thank goodness I found you!
fluttershy Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
fluttershy There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
fluttershy A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!
fluttershy NO! Never look one in the eye. If you look a cockatrice in the eye--
fluttershy [brush rustling, a chicken cluck]
fluttershy Girls! Wait!
fluttershy See? Now we have to --
fluttershy Girls, please. Girls-- now listen to me, girls, I-- please!
fluttershy 
fluttershy [cockatrice squawking]
fluttershy GIRLS! Behind me, NOW!
fluttershy [cockatrice squawking and roaring]
fluttershy YOU! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
fluttershy You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?
fluttershy Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
fluttershy Oh, you DO, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... The Stare.
fluttershy 
fluttershy And that's when it brought you back from stone.
fluttershy Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
fluttershy I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.
fluttershy Did you finish all those capes?
fluttershy Won't you stay for some tea?
fluttershy Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?
fluttershy Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
fluttershy I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
fluttershy Of course. How about later today?
fluttershy [Opal yowls]
fluttershy 
fluttershy [closing credits]
fluttershy Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!
fluttershy But they blocked up all the holes.
fluttershy Oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
fluttershy Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
fluttershy Is everything all right?
fluttershy Photo Finish?
fluttershy What a lovely compliment.
fluttershy That's wonderful.
fluttershy Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
fluttershy Oh, goodness. I don't know.
fluttershy I'm flattered, really.
fluttershy But...
fluttershy There has to be somepony more quali...
fluttershy Somepony more into fashion.
fluttershy Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
fluttershy Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.
fluttershy What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
fluttershy A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
fluttershy I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
fluttershy Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything.
fluttershy Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
fluttershy I can't, Rarity.
fluttershy 
fluttershy N... nervous.
fluttershy You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
fluttershy Oh, yes. Best time ever...
fluttershy I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?
fluttershy Photo Finish?
fluttershy Um... Photo Finish?
fluttershy Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.
fluttershy Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
fluttershy Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?
fluttershy Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated I could just scream. 
fluttershy No. Can I tell you something?
fluttershy You promise not to tell Rarity?
fluttershy Pinkie Pie-swear?
fluttershy I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I MUST!  I must...
fluttershy Oh, what were you about to say?
fluttershy Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.
fluttershy Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!
fluttershy You really think it'll work?
fluttershy This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
fluttershy [kicks a vase, vase wobbles]
fluttershy If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
fluttershy I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
fluttershy You did?!
fluttershy Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.
fluttershy More than anything.
fluttershy I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria".
fluttershy Never!
fluttershy If we just told each other the truth.
fluttershy Me too.
fluttershy Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
fluttershy I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.
fluttershy We go!
fluttershy Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
fluttershy Awwww!
fluttershy I'd like to be a tree...
fluttershy Huffy the magic dragon!
fluttershy A stampede of buffalo.
fluttershy And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
fluttershy But why?
fluttershy Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
fluttershy [indistinct "Oh, there you are!" "Thank goodness!"]
fluttershy There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all.
fluttershy Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.
fluttershy You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
fluttershy [a clock strikes four]
fluttershy I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go?
fluttershy 
fluttershy Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it! [departs, then returns] Oh, thanks, Angel. [and again] I mean, if if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered and then... then I wouldn't be there and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late.
fluttershy Oh, okay then. See you later.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy Phew. Made it.
fluttershy  No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
fluttershy Thanks, Twilight.
fluttershy Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
fluttershy Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
fluttershy But she's met us all before.
fluttershy Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
fluttershy Or... perhaps not that casual.
fluttershy It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice.
fluttershy Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.
fluttershy Yes, I love to take care of animals.
fluttershy Oh... my.
fluttershy I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
fluttershy Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly. I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help.
fluttershy Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.
fluttershy There.
fluttershy This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!
fluttershy Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.
fluttershy Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
fluttershy Always works.
fluttershy Uh... Almost always.
fluttershy There's nothing like home-made soup
fluttershy to cure what ails you.
fluttershy Come on now. You'd not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.
fluttershy Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here come the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
fluttershy Oh dear.
fluttershy Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing.
fluttershy Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy? Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
fluttershy Aw, look. I think he likes you.
fluttershy Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it.
fluttershy Um... good try?
fluttershy I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?
fluttershy Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...
fluttershy Aromatherapy?
fluttershy Warm bath?
fluttershy Ointment?
fluttershy Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
fluttershy Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever.
fluttershy I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
fluttershy How could I just walk away and not do anything?
fluttershy I had to do something.
fluttershy But...
fluttershy But...
fluttershy  You're right. Okay, let's...
fluttershy ...go.
fluttershy [excessive coughing]
fluttershy But it's daytime.
fluttershy Going to return Philomena, remember?
fluttershy Why not?
fluttershy Do you?
fluttershy You really think the princess would do that?
fluttershy All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
fluttershy Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the Princess. And everything will be fine.
fluttershy I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
fluttershy She can't fly.
fluttershy Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.
fluttershy I don't think she likes it.
fluttershy Of course, but...
fluttershy Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.
fluttershy It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
fluttershy I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
fluttershy No! Philomena! Come back!
fluttershy Excuse me!
fluttershy Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!
fluttershy I'll catch you!
fluttershy 
fluttershy [cries/whimpers]
fluttershy It's all my fault.
fluttershy I'm the one who did it.
fluttershy Some help I was.
fluttershy But it's my fault!
fluttershy Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.
fluttershy I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
fluttershy A... A phoenix?
fluttershy So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
fluttershy I guess I have some imagination.
fluttershy I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
fluttershy It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.
fluttershy All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?
fluttershy Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
fluttershy Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
fluttershy You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer.
fluttershy It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere...
fluttershy  I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I've never been near the ground before.
fluttershy What is this place
fluttershy filled with so many wonders?
fluttershy Casting its spell
fluttershy That I am now under
fluttershy Squirrels in the trees
fluttershy and the cute little bunnies
fluttershy Birds flying free
fluttershy and bees with their honey
fluttershy Hooneeeeey!
fluttershy Oooh, what a magical place
fluttershy and I owe it all to the Pegasus race
fluttershy If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
fluttershy I'd have come here sooner, and never leave
fluttershy Yes, I love everythiiiiiiiiiiiing!
fluttershy 
fluttershy  Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
fluttershy Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.
fluttershy Bye, girls!
fluttershy Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
fluttershy Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
fluttershy I'm so glad we're friends!
fluttershy Hey. How about a song?
fluttershy He's just wonderful.
fluttershy Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
fluttershy You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
fluttershy It’s been lovely.
fluttershy As in…?
fluttershy It’s… uh… a big house.
fluttershy He’s… a bear.
fluttershy It’s, uh, really more of a cave.
fluttershy And, uh, he wants us to look after his house… uh, cave… while he’s, uh…
fluttershy [over Rainbow Dash] Collect sea shells! ...Play beach volleyball! ...Collect volleyballs!
fluttershy Not since this morning.
fluttershy I’m just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn’t be there.
fluttershy As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
fluttershy  
fluttershy [in unison] Surprise!
fluttershy I really thought she’d be more excited.
fluttershy Don’t worry about it.
fluttershy Oh, definitely.
fluttershy Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?
fluttershy Opalescence, no!
fluttershy At the Gala, in the garden
fluttershy I'm going to see them all!
fluttershy All the creatures, I'll befriend them at the Gala! (at the Gala!)
fluttershy All the birdies, and the critters
fluttershy They will love me big and small!
fluttershy We'll become good friends forever
fluttershy Right here at the Gala!
fluttershy Meet new friends
fluttershy To meet!
fluttershy Oh my! A meadowlark!
fluttershy 
fluttershy I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for! 
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy  My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
fluttershy 
fluttershy Was that you?
fluttershy Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
fluttershy [animal noises]
fluttershy Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?
fluttershy Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.
fluttershy This isn't what I wished for.
fluttershy ...for this moment.
fluttershy I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.  I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
fluttershy [sound of crunching]
fluttershy Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
fluttershy COME OUT!
fluttershy I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be MINE! MINE!!! [scariest laughter you'll ever hear] Whoa!
fluttershy You're... going to LOVE ME!
fluttershy Talking!
fluttershy Now, Angel, you really shouldn't– No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!
fluttershy Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
fluttershy 
fluttershy Can we go home now?
fluttershy W-We have to go in there?
fluttershy 
fluttershy  What's that? Who's there? Girls!
fluttershy Okay, I can do this. I can...   Oh, Wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!
fluttershy Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
fluttershy Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
fluttershy Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.
fluttershy Aw, boo hoo hoo! [Twilight is shocked] Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
fluttershy Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one.
fluttershy [Fluttershy whips her tail in Twilight's face]
fluttershy Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha.
fluttershy No. Ha, ha.
fluttershy No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
fluttershy Ha, ha.
fluttershy I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha.
fluttershy Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud.
fluttershy Don't worry, you won't. 
fluttershy With pleasure.
fluttershy 'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
fluttershy Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
fluttershy Your face! 
fluttershy Hah!
fluttershy [sing-song voice] Keep away!
fluttershy Hmph! Garbage.
fluttershy  Oops, sorry, Rainbow Crash. 
fluttershy Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
fluttershy Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!
fluttershy Uh? She's not here.
fluttershy Got it!
fluttershy Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
fluttershy [whimper/crying] I can't!
fluttershy That big...dumb...MEANIE!
fluttershy [assorted grunts]
fluttershy [continued assorted grunts]
fluttershy You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
fluttershy [various shock statements]
fluttershy Yes?
fluttershy Yes?
fluttershy Yes?
fluttershy [sighs of relief]
fluttershy Oh thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened.
fluttershy 
fluttershy Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
fluttershy Why would you enchant your doll?
fluttershy Magic kindergarten?
fluttershy Please, your highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset...
fluttershy Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
fluttershy Mmhmm.
fluttershy [All right, etc]
fluttershy 
fluttershy We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
fluttershy 
fluttershy Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
fluttershy It is you. Oh, and Nightmare Moon.  Nightmare Moon?!
fluttershy Likewise.
fluttershy  Okay.
fluttershy  Okay.
fluttershy  Okay.
fluttershy  Perfectlessonover.
fluttershy [nervous, dazed laughter] Yes.
fluttershy I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
fluttershy Oh, please don't be mad at us.
fluttershy Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house. Oh, and I know you'll just love them, and they'll love you, oh! And you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!
fluttershy Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight
fluttershy It's abundantly clear
fluttershy That somewhere out here
fluttershy Is the pet that will suit you just right
fluttershy Awesome, cool, got it!
fluttershy I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see
fluttershy Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
fluttershy They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
fluttershy Rainbow, have faith
fluttershy You see, I will bet you
fluttershy Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you
fluttershy Come on, the sky's the limit!
fluttershy Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!
fluttershy I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide
fluttershy There are otters and seals
fluttershy With massive appeal
fluttershy Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
fluttershy Wait! There must be a pet here
fluttershy That will fit the ticket
fluttershy How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?
fluttershy Bigger, cooler. Right.
fluttershy I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash
fluttershy Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely
fluttershy Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!
fluttershy I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
fluttershy I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky
fluttershy Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
fluttershy I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?
fluttershy There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that
fluttershy There are falcons and eagles
fluttershy They are both quite regal
fluttershy Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?
fluttershy Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.
fluttershy No.
fluttershy I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you
fluttershy Don't forget style, that should be considered
fluttershy The one who is awesome as cool
fluttershy So a contest we will see
fluttershy In the world for me
fluttershy May the games
fluttershy Begin
fluttershy Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and-
fluttershy Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here.
fluttershy Oh, just let him try.
fluttershy It won't hurt to let him try.
fluttershy Just let him try?
fluttershy Tortoise.
fluttershy Where's Rainbow Dash?
fluttershy It's the turtle!
fluttershy ...whatever...
fluttershy Maybe we'd better go meet him half way.
fluttershy Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
fluttershy The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?
fluttershy Yay?
fluttershy But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
fluttershy She really cares about everypony's safety.
fluttershy Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.
fluttershy Oh, poor Opal, where is the sick darling?
fluttershy Poor baby.
fluttershy She looks awful.
fluttershy Happy birthday, Spike.
fluttershy 
fluttershy I'm up here!
fluttershy I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
fluttershy Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
fluttershy Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!
fluttershy I- if you wouldn't mind, that is...
fluttershy We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy  We did it! I can't believe we did it!
fluttershy I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting!  Woo hoo!
fluttershy Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!
fluttershy No?
fluttershy So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
fluttershy A lot?
fluttershy Hundreds?
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy [wind rushing]
fluttershy Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?
fluttershy 
fluttershy Conquer, sir?
fluttershy I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow.
fluttershy 
fluttershy What a view... I can see my future house from here.
fluttershy I vote for calm.
fluttershy  
fluttershy [windigo roaring]
fluttershy 
fluttershy What is that... thing?
fluttershy Windigos?
fluttershy Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.
fluttershy Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
fluttershy What was that?
fluttershy Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me are you? Please don't be mad at me!
fluttershy Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
fluttershy I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling.
fluttershy  Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.
fluttershy Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
fluttershy I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
fluttershy We're so glad you're safe!
fluttershy Are you okay?
fluttershy Um, excuse me?
fluttershy Ooh... Can you please slow down?
fluttershy Help!
fluttershy STOP!
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy Nn-nn.
fluttershy Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
fluttershy  Who could that be? It's still dark!
fluttershy 
fluttershy   Oh, where are we? What's the rush?
fluttershy Um, well, uh-
fluttershy I guess I-
fluttershy Gee Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
fluttershy [zipping noise]
fluttershy Oh, gosh Pinkie. I love your new style.
fluttershy For the record, I don't mind-
fluttershy Uh, Pinkie Pie-
fluttershy Got it.
fluttershy  Oh, I'm so worried!
fluttershy It's not so bad Rainbow Dash.
fluttershy Hi Rainbow Dash!
fluttershy We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
fluttershy We know how much you like to win!
fluttershy Um... sky five?
fluttershy But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
fluttershy Glad we could... cheer you up?
fluttershy Lunch time! Who's hungry? Plenty for everypony. Slow down, sweetie. 
fluttershy Here you go, Angel bunny.
fluttershy Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum! What? But- Then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of-  I'll make your special recipe.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me... umm... I think you just stepped in front of me...? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first and-
fluttershy I know.
fluttershy Oh, pardon me, sir-
fluttershy I think you just cut in front of me.
fluttershy I said [into ear trumpet] I think you just cut in front of me.
fluttershy I noticed.
fluttershy Hey!
fluttershy But-
fluttershy Oh, okay. There's no rush.
fluttershy Oh, it-it's really no big deal...
fluttershy What problem? Oh, go right ahead Pinkie Pie, you first.
fluttershy A doormat?
fluttershy Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good!
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy Oh, that's okay, I don't mind.
fluttershy ...um... I guess not.
fluttershy Let's see... I also need tomatoes.
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy Here you go.
fluttershy Oh, but last week it was only one bit.
fluttershy Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it.
fluttershy I guess you're right!
fluttershy Um... okay. [to self] I need that cherry. [to cherry stallholder] Boy am I glad you have one cherry left. You see I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel, he's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy Here you go.
fluttershy Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!
fluttershy Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
fluttershy Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits!
fluttershy Umm...I mean, nine bits!
fluttershy Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
fluttershy It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
fluttershy But... I was only doing what you did.
fluttershy But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
fluttershy Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!
fluttershy Tada! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel?  Look at me... I really am a doormat. [reading from pamphlet] The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre. As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!
fluttershy [ponies chattering]
fluttershy Oh! Ah! Uh... excuse me! 
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy [music playing on Eye of the Tiger starts]
fluttershy [goats bleat]
fluttershy [fireworks explode]
fluttershy [ponies cheering]
fluttershy Who, me?
fluttershy  Uh, well...
fluttershy  Okay.
fluttershy Um, politely walk around him?
fluttershy Gingerly tip-toe around him?
fluttershy Go back home and try again tomorrow?
fluttershy Oh! Sorry.
fluttershy Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won’t be sorry when I do!
fluttershy Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to “attack the day”, as Iron Will says.
fluttershy [water spraying]
fluttershy Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias...
fluttershy ...again...
fluttershy “Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over.”
fluttershy Thank you. [excited giggle] I can't believe it worked!
fluttershy [clears throat] Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
fluttershy A-hemmmm, can you move, you're blocking my path.
fluttershy “When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!”
fluttershy Good!
fluttershy What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?
fluttershy 'Maybe'? “Maybes are for babies!”  Now go to the back of the line where you belong!
fluttershy [VCR rewind sound]
fluttershy Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work.
fluttershy Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
fluttershy “You laugh at me, I wrath at you!”
fluttershy 
fluttershy Bye, girls.
fluttershy [ponies running away]
fluttershy What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. “Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!”
fluttershy [fight sounds]
fluttershy Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!  Nopony!
fluttershy You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!
fluttershy And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
fluttershy “You apologize, I penalize!"
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy [mail cart zooms in and out]
fluttershy  Sure, you just- 
fluttershy  “You make me lose, I blow my fuse!”
fluttershy Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
fluttershy What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
fluttershy No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!
fluttershy Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?
fluttershy Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
fluttershy Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
fluttershy Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!  ...I'm the monster.
fluttershy [wind blows]
fluttershy [wolf howls]
fluttershy  Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
fluttershy  Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame.  But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
fluttershy I, I'm not sure I can, I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself I become a monster.
fluttershy [lightning strikes]
fluttershy 
fluttershy Um, no.
fluttershy [goat bleats]
fluttershy No.
fluttershy As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied.
fluttershy Well I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that.
fluttershy [goats bleating]
fluttershy I'm sorry, but no means no.
fluttershy Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?
fluttershy 
fluttershy Dear Princess Celestia, sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant, or mean.
fluttershy 
fluttershy  Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
fluttershy 
fluttershy Oh!
fluttershy [horn blowing]
fluttershy Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
fluttershy Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
fluttershy There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes. Fun, no.
fluttershy Now that you put it that way, yes!
fluttershy Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
fluttershy Thanks, but... no thanks!
fluttershy I said... no!
fluttershy [high pitched growling] 
fluttershy Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash. [coughs weakly]
fluttershy Oh, I  I think I have [coughs weakly] the pony pox. I'm sorry, I really, really wanted to come to training day today [coughs weakly] but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop. Achoo. [coughs weakly]
fluttershy I know, plenty of bed-
fluttershy 
fluttershy 
fluttershy Oh, y'know, all of a sudden I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] I'll just get out of these robes and- ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt, I guess I can't fly after all-
fluttershy 
fluttershy Well, y'see, uh, well, oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!
fluttershy But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
fluttershy You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!
fluttershy The other foals used to tease me, a lot!
fluttershy I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
fluttershy Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...
fluttershy Wait. I'll do it.
fluttershy I will.
fluttershy I'm game.
fluttershy [takes deep breath]
fluttershy 
fluttershy  Yes!
fluttershy I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now...
fluttershy  
fluttershy [squirrel chittering]
fluttershy Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
fluttershy [duck quacking]
fluttershy I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
fluttershy [birds chirp]
fluttershy I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy ...and you were scared...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!
fluttershy [animal noises]
fluttershy [training montage music begins]
fluttershy 2.3. 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
fluttershy No I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power by tomorrow!
fluttershy How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
fluttershy Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
fluttershy Twilight!
fluttershy I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
fluttershy Oh no! That's terrible news!
fluttershy [water splashing]
fluttershy 
fluttershy Oh, I'm too nervous to look!
fluttershy I won't make a difference!
fluttershy My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
fluttershy  
fluttershy No!
fluttershy Whuh, what? Did we do it?
fluttershy Ah!
fluttershy Dear Princess Celestia, sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.
fluttershy [Cloudsdale chugging]
fluttershy 
fluttershy [bell rings]
fluttershy [foals chattering]
fluttershy [muffled crying]
fluttershy  Oh my.
fluttershy So did I.
fluttershy So tasty.
fluttershy And it was so good.
fluttershy But I'm really really sorry.
fluttershy Oh my goodness! What an honor!
fluttershy Um, Twilight? Are you okay?
fluttershy She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
fluttershy But... he was singing really off-key.
fluttershy [bird sings off-key]
fluttershy Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
fluttershy [excited chatter]
fluttershy Oh goodness! Are you okay?
fluttershy Rarity!
fluttershy Oh, um. Excuse me! Oh! Hello! I was just wondering. Oh, oh that's okay. You all look really busy.
fluttershy They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
fluttershy Oh, we have to get this right
fluttershy Yes we have to make them see
fluttershy We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
fluttershy Oh, we have to get this right
fluttershy Yes we have to make them see
fluttershy We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
