01 01 ...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
01 01 Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
01 01 I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
01 01 Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
01 01 There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
01 01 Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
01 01 No, no, no... no, no, no!  Spike!
01 01 Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?
01 01 Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal!  Spike! Do you know what this means?
01 01 Take a note please, to the Princess.
01 01 My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
01 01 Threshold.
01 01 Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
01 01 Great! Send it.
01 01 Of course!
01 01 That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!
01 01 Important!
01 01 Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
01 01 See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
01 01 Mm-hm!
01 01 Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
01 01 She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
01 01 Thank you, sirs.
01 01 Um... hello?
01 01 Well, that was interesting all right.
01 01  Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle-
01 01 Friends? Actually, I-
01 01 [clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?
01 01 As long as it doesn't take too long...
01 01 [triangle ringing]
01 01 Thanks, but I really need to hurry-
01 01  [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.
01 01 Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...
01 01 ...fine.
01 01 Ugh... I ate too much pie...
01 01 Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she.
01 01 
01 01 
01 01 Nng.
01 01 Nnnn.
01 01 Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
01 01 I heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear.  I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather.
01 01 Practicing for what?
01 01 The Wonderbolts?
01 01 The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
01 01 Pfft, please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
01 01 Prove it.
01 01 [whooshing noises]
01 01 Rrgh.
01 01 Yes, the decor is coming along nicely. This oughta be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.
01 01 Good afternoon-
01 01 Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!
01 01 Wait! Where are we going?! Help!
01 01  I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to-
01 01 Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
01 01 Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
01 01 Hello!
01 01 Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful.  I'm Twilight Sparkle.  What's your name?
01 01 I'm sorry, what was that?
01 01 Didn't quite catch that.
01 01  Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!
01 01 Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy.
01 01 Well, in that case we'd better be going.
01 01 
01 01 I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
01 01 Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
01 01 Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!
01 01 [door slamming]
01 01 Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?
01 01 
01 01 Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
01 01 
01 01 
01 01 [door opens, music gets louder]
01 01 No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
01 01 [mockingly imitates Spike]
01 01 [door closes, music stops]
01 01 Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old ponytale...
01 01 This can't be good.
01 01 Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
01 01 I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!
01 01 [ponies gasping]
01 01 You're here to... to... 
01 02 "Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon"?
01 02 She will bring about nighttime eternal.
01 02 It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
01 02 See? I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
01 02 All the ponies in this town are crazy!
01 02 I hope the Princess was right.
01 02 Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
01 02 You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?
01 02 I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them, I don't even know what they do!
01 02 How did you find that?!
01 02 Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now--
01 02 Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own.
01 02 
01 02 So, none of you have been in here before?
01 02 What's that supposed to mean?
01 02 
01 02 Applejack! What do I do?
01 02 Are you crazy?
01 02 That's not true!
01 02  Phew-wah!
01 02 Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta-  A manticore!
01 02 We've gotta get past him!
01 02 Rainbow!
01 02 How did you know about the thorn?
01 02 That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
01 02 Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
01 02 Tell me she's not...
01 02 Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
01 02 Rarity, what are you-
01 02 Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
01 02  We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
01 02 There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it.
01 02 We're almost there. Whoa!
01 02 Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them.
01 02 The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!
01 02 The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.
01 02 I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
01 02 Aah!
01 02 The Elements!
01 02 [All five ponies talking over each other: >Fluttershy
01 02 Twilight? >Applejack
01 02 What? >Rarity
01 02 Where did she go? >Pinkie Pie
01 02 What happened? >Rainbow Dash
01 02 What's going on?]
01 02 [coughs, gasps]
01 02 
01 02  Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!
01 02  But... where's the sixth Element?!
01 02  You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here.
01 02 Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty!
01 02 Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness!
01 02 Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter!
01 02 Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity!
01 02 And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty!
01 02 The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
01 02 But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all are...my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!
01 02  Princess Celestia.
01 02 But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
01 02 That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
01 02 Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.
01 02 [ponies cheer]
01 03 No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.
01 03 Puh-leez, Spike, you've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.
01 03 [stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food.
01 03 Oh Spike, that looks delicious. Spike.
01 03 It's a letter from Princess Celestia.
01 03  The Grand Galloping Gala!
01 03 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 03 The Grand Galloping Gala! 
01 03 Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?
01 03 Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.
01 03 Oh, well in that case, would you like to--
01 03 Yeah, but--
01 03 Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?
01 03 Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles]  Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?
01 03 I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?
01 03 Um, actually--
01 03 Uh--
01 03 Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
01 03 Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful?
01 03 Rainbow Dash, were you following me?
01 03 Applejack, were you following me too?
01 03 Girls, there's no use in arguing.
01 03 Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo.
01 03 [ponies grumble]
01 03 And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.
01 03  Spike, what am I gonna do? All five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. Applejack, or Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity... Oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]
01 03 I CAN'T DECIDE!
01 03 Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
01 03 What do you think, Spike?
01 03 I mean about the gala and the ticket and who I should take.
01 03 Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I--
01 03 Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
01 03 [ponies galloping]
01 03 It's not raining. What's going on?
01 03 Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?
01 03 Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?
01 03 Uh-huh.
01 03 Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.
01 03 That's better. 
01 03 No, really?
01 03 Heh heh, oops, sorry.
01 03 Uh...
01 03 Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.
01 03 Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?
01 03  Oh, Spike.
01 03 Wait, The Grand--
01 03 I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch.
01 03 You've got to be kidding me!
01 03 [stomach grumbles]
01 03 No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!
01 03 Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.
01 03  Fluttershy, not you too?
01 03 It's summer.
01 03 You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
01 03 No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
01 03 Pinkie...
01 03 Pinkie.
01 03 Pinkie!
01 03 At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
01 03 We're... gonna... run!
01 03 
01 03 [ponies offer favors]
01 03 I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!
01 03 Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,
01 03 I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala.
01 03 If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.
01 03 Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.
01 03 It's okay girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all.
01 03 A letter from the princess? That was fast.
01 03 Now we can all go.
01 03 [ponies cheer]
01 03 [stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]
01 04 Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
01 04 We all ready?
01 04 Is Applejack all set?
01 04 Welcome everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--
01 04 Exactly. And...
01 04 What does that have to do with Applejack?
01 04 Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--
01 04 --rupted.
01 04 Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind.
01 04 Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
01 04 Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--
01 04 Hmm.
01 04 What on Earth is that pony doing?
01 04 Hey Applejack!
01 04 Applejack.
01 04 Applejack. AppleJACK!
01 04 What is all this?
01 04 Applewhat season?
01 04 But why are you doing it all alone?
01 04 What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
01 04 Fine.
01 04 I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
01 04 Do you... want some help?
01 04 But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
01 04 Uhm... no?
01 04 Can I help you?
01 04 Applejack?
01 04 Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?
01 04 No. Can we talk?
01 04 No! I need to talk to you.
01 04 I need to talk to you!
01 04 Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
01 04 Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
01 04 Because you're working too hard and you need help.
01 04 HELP! You need HELP!
01 04 Ugh.
01 04 We came as soon as we heard.
01 04 Oh no! What happened?
01 04 Applejack.
01 04 Applejack, we need to talk.
01 04 Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
01 04 Here, let me help.
01 04 AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
01 04 Actually Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--
01 04 But if you'd just let me help--
01 04 Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
01 04 [mule neighing]
01 04 No offense.
01 04  
01 04 I don't get it.
01 04 Alright. Enough is enough.
01 04 Alright, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.
01 04 Applejack. Applejack.
01 04 Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help any pony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
01 04 I am not taking "no" for an answer--what?
01 04  
01 04 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 04 My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help any pony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
01 04 Your faithful student,
01 04 Twilight Sparkle
01 04 A bit?
01 05 Uh-huh.
01 05 Uh-huh. Phew.
01 05 Isn't she right up there?
01 05 Hmm?
01 05 So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
01 05 You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.
01 05 Well, I think... you're jealous.
01 05 Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.
01 05 
01 05 You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
01 05 Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike. She is the guest of honor after all.
01 05 Spike.
01 05 Wow, what was that about?
01 05 [ponies talking indistinctly]
01 05 Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks likes I'm the one who misjudged you.
01 05 Dearest Princess Celestia,
01 05 Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and the one who is true will surely come to light.
01 05 Your faithful student,
01 05 Twilight Sparkle
01 06 Okay, here goes.
01 06 [magical chime]
01 06 Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.
01 06 
01 06 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 06 True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
01 06 Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.
01 06 Really?
01 06 Where is this unicorn?
01 06 There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?
01 06 Spike! Shhh!
01 06 You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
01 06 
01 06 There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since--
01 06 
01 06 
01 06 I-- I--
01 06 Uh...
01 06 Nothing.
01 06 What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
01 06 I'm not better than anyone.
01 06 Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.
01 06 Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.
01 06 No, Spike, it's exactly the same.
01 06 I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
01 06 [door slam, door open]
01 06 Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!
01 06 I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!
01 06 Uh, is that what I think it is?
01 06 What's going on?
01 06 You what!?!
01 06 
01 06 
01 06 
01 06 [music from broken cattails]
01 06 
01 06 I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.
01 06 Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--
01 06 So, you don't mind my magic tricks?
01 06 You are?
01 06 That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
01 06 That wasn't an Ursa Major, it was a baby, an Ursa Minor.
01 06 And it wasn't rampaging, it was just cranky because someone woke it up.
01 06 You don't wanna know.
01 06 Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.
01 06 For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?
01 06 I think you're right.
01 06 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 06 I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.
01 06 Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?
01 06 You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself.
01 06 Uh, not this again!
01 07 Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
01 07 But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
01 07 It's coming from a dragon.
01 07 Sleeping.
01 07 According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke.
01 07 We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
01 07 All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour.
01 07 All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
01 07 The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
01 07 Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way.
01 07 Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that.
01 07 Uh-huh.
01 07 Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
01 07 Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone.
01 07 Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.
01 07 All right girls, move out!
01 07 That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
01 07 Girls, this is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?
01 07 Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?
01 07 Your turn, Fluttershy.
01 07 Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.
01 07 We don't have time for this.
01 07 You've got it.
01 07 Just don't look down.
01 07  Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide.
01 07 Shhh!
01 07 Oh no! Help! Ooh!
01 07 
01 07 Thanks to you I am.
01 07 Yeah, we'll just have to  climb over.
01 07 
01 07 We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.
01 07 Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
01 07 [squeaky toy]
01 07 Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?
01 07 
01 07 Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on!  We have to do this!  Now! Every  second longer that dragon  sleeps is another  acre of Equestria that is covered in  smoke. Ooh!
01 07 What?
01 07 But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
01 07 But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?
01 07 Oh, Fluttershy.
01 07 I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing. Right?
01 07 [ponies agree nervously]
01 07 Mr. Dragon.
01 07 Excuse me.
01 07 Mr. Dragon.
01 07 Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight--
01 07 Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come her to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke.  Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?
01 07 So, you'll find another place to sleep? 
01 07 
01 07 You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
01 07 Rainbow! No!
01 07 You did it! I knew you could do it.
01 07 Spike, take a letter.
01 07 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 07 I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
01 07 Always your faithful student,
01 07 Twilight Sparkle.
01 08 Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
01 08 Come inside girls, quick.
01 08 It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
01 08 Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
01 08 Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight.  You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those.
01 08 My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!
01 08 We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book.
01 08 Hurray slumber party!
01 08 [loud chewing] Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.
01 08 This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
01 08 This is so awesome!  Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?
01 08 I've got one! This story is called The Legend of the Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...
01 08 ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was -- the Headless Horse!
01 08 Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?
01 08 Ooo!
01 08 S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.
01 08 Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever any pony dares you to do.
01 08 You have to. It's the rule.
01 08 Um, do I ever get a turn?
01 08 I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?
01 08 Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?
01 08  Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
01 08 Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!
01 08 I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?  Sorry I asked.
01 08 
01 08 
01 08 It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!
01 08 Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
01 08 Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?
01 08 Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either.
01 08  Nope.
01 08  No! Only three of your twenty questions left!
01 08 Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
01 08 Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!
01 08 That's it!
01 08 No.  It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together.
01 08 See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
01 08 I declare my first slumber party a success!
01 08 Have fun, check.
01 08 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 08 It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you'd just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.
01 08 So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?
01 09 Wow, what a gorgeous day!
01 09 I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
01 09 Not that I know of.
01 09 Not more than usual.
01 09 Uh... not very likely.
01 09 
01 09 Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?
01 09  Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?
01 09 Well, I saw her glance this way...
01 09 ... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
01 09 
01 09 [Everyone but Twilight gasp]
01 09 Will you cut that out?
01 09 She's a zebra.
01 09 A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with.
01 09 Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a far away land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?
01 09 Spike!
01 09 Wow. Catchy.
01 09 This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
01 09  Oooooh.
01 09  Oh, my.
01 09  Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?
01 09 And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?
01 09 I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.
01 09 You ponies are being ridiculous!
01 09 Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!
01 09 Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back.
01 09  Oh brother.
01 09 You guys, there's no such thing as curses!
01 09 My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.
01 09 Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa!  Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!
01 09 No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
01 09 I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
01 09 "Supernaturals"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!
01 09 Pinkie? What happened?
01 09 But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
01 09 Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not gonna to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?
01 09 [Sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!
01 09 It's not a curse!
01 09 It's not a hex either!
01 09 [Everyone but Apple Bloom and Spike shouting at once]
01 09 ... or sat on her?
01 09 Apple Bloom is gone too!
01 09 Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go.
01 09 C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
01 09 Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.
01 09 Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?  Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?
01 09 Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
01 09 What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?
01 09 [All ponies scream]
01 09 What have you done with Apple Bloom?
01 09 We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
01 09 You ruined my horn!
01 09 Where is Apple Bloom!?
01 09 Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
01 09 Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.
01 09 I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes that played on us.
01 09 But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
01 09 But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
01 09 Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals: Natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super. I...I... I'm so sorry Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.
01 09 Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
01 09 Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.
01 09 Daisy, we need to talk.
01 09 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 09 my friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; It's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
01 10 Oh! Hurry up Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
01 10 Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
01 10 There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
01 10 Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
01 10 Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
01 10 What happened to the rest of her name?
01 10 You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.
01 10 That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
01 10 Hello Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
01 10 Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
01 10 They're amazing. What are they?
01 10 I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
01 10 A para-what?
01 10 A what?
01 10 Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
01 10 Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
01 10 The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
01 10  The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
01 10 Oh,  what's there to worry about?
01 10 Spike! Wake up! What happened?
01 10 Where did they come from?
01 10 The princess will be here in a few hours.
01 10 Spike, help me round up these little guys.
01 10 
01 10 Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
01 10 ...or not.
01 10 Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
01 10 
01 10 If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
01 10  I got it! No pony can herd like Applejack.
01 10 Pinkie!
01 10 You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
01 10 Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
01 10 We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
01 10 Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
01 10 Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
01 10 Where did they come from?
01 10 We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
01 10  Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
01 10 Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
01 10 Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
01 10 We've gotta do something.  I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
01 10 
01 10 
01 10  They're eating the words. 
01 10 Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
01 10 I don't know! Is it?
01 10 
01 10  Oh no, here she comes.
01 10 [ponies scream]
01 10 Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
01 10 Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over.
01 10 [polka music]
01 10 Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
01 10 Look.
01 10 Hello, princess.
01 10 So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
01 10 Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
01 10 An... infestation?
01 10 Trouble? What trouble?
01 10 My... report?
01 10 Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives , even when they don't always seem to make sense.
01 10 Thank you, princess.
01 10 Emergency in Fillydelphia.
01 10 I think the princess can handle it.
01 10 We know Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
01 10 [>Rainbow Dash
01 10 I'm sorry, Pinkie.] [>Rarity
01 10 So sorry, Pinkie.] [>Fluttershy
01 10 Sorry, Pinkie.] [>Applejack
01 10 Real sorry, Pinkie.]
01 10 You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
01 10 You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.
01 10 ...Or not.
01 10 
01 10 
01 10 
01 11 
01 11  Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!
01 11 Winter Wrap Up!
01 11 Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so every pony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready.
01 11 No Spike, Ponyville was started by Earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. It's traditional. 
01 11 Okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early.
01 11 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 11 Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.
01 11 Oh, this is so exciting.
01 11 Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?
01 11 The time has come to welcome spring
01 11 And all things warm and green
01 11 But it's also time to say goodbye
01 11 It's winter we must clean
01 11 How can I help? I'm new, you see
01 11 What does everypony do?
01 11 How do I fit in without magic?
01 11 I haven't got a clue!
01 11 Now that I know what they all do
01 11 I have to find my place
01 11 And help with all of my heart
01 11 Tough task ahead I face
01 11 How will I do without my magic
01 11 Help the Earth pony way
01 11 I wanna belong so I must
01 11 Do my best today,
01 11 Do my best today!
01 11 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
01 11 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
01 11 'Cause tomorrow spring is here!
01 11 Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?
01 11 Rainbow Dash!
01 11 What are you doing?
01 11 Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?
01 11 Right. No wings.
01 11  Great, now what do we do?
01 11 Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow.
01 11 Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with.
01 11 Birds' nests?
01 11 Wow Rarity, that one's really beautiful.
01 11 Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
01 11 There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
01 11 Hw...
01 11 Wow Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.
01 11 How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.
01 11 Would I?
01 11 Okay.
01 11 Uh... maybe on second thought.
01 11 Oh no, whoa, wow...
01 11 Yaaaaa!
01 11 Really?
01 11 Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess.
01 11 Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.
01 11 Yaaaaaa!
01 11 Awww, how cute.
01 11 Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.
01 11 Okay, let's start there.
01 11 [bell rings]
01 11 Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. [bell rings] I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken.
01 11 Waaa! Snakes! Snakes!  Ugh!   Ugh!
01 11 
01 11  All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
01 11 No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.
01 11 No, no, no! I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me. 
01 11 Hey Applejack. How's everything going?
01 11 Well, I'd like to help.
01 11 Just give me a chance.
01 11  Ugh...  Ugh... 
01 11 I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
01 11  Uh oh. Slow down. Slow down!
01 11 Well, see, I just wanted to... 
01 11 I'm a winter mess up.
01 11  Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
01 11 Did she say late?
01 11 Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!
01 11 Stop everypony. [ponies argue] Stop. [bird chirps] Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job.
01 11 It was a team effort.
01 11 Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you everypony.
01 11 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 11 Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?
01 11 Oh, Spike. 
01 11 
01 11 
01 12 [school bell rings]
01 12 [students chatter happily]
01 12 Whoa, what's been going on in here?
01 12 Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.
01 12 What's the matter?
01 12 Uhhh… I don't follow. How can I help you?
01 12 Oh no Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.
01 12 I'm sorry but-
01 12 Alright alright!
01 12 I'm sorry sweetie, but I told you-
01 12 
01 12            
01 12 Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
01 12 I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
01 12 I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
01 12 They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.
01 12 Dearest Princess Celestia,
01 12 I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
01 13 So you two are doing what, now?
01 13 And I'm here to...?
01 13 Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?
01 13 Ready. Set. Go!
01 13 Time, Spike?
01 13 Ready. Set. Go!
01 13 Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
01 13 Go!
01 13 Go!
01 13 Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
01 13 Who are you talking to?
01 13 95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!
01 13 All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got.
01 13 Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
01 13 Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.
01 13 I'm racing.
01 13 I'm not joking.
01 13 I am not an egghead, I am well read.
01 13 Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.
01 13 Books. I've read several on the subject.
01 13 Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the running of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.
01 13 I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
01 13 She did not.
01 13 She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
01 13 Just be careful!
01 13 Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
01 13 Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.
01 13 Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.
01 13 Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?
01 13 Except that the other racers just passed you.
01 13 Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?
01 13 Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering that I've never run a race before.
01 13 Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.
01 13 Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.
01 13 It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
01 14 Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
01 14 Looks like a dress.
01 14 Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
01 14 Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
01 14 But...
01 14 Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
01 14 What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
01 14 Wow... They're...
01 14 Yes! Something.
01 14 They're very nice...
01 14 I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
01 14 [collective yeah]
01 14 Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.
01 14 Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.
01 14 That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
01 14 Gotta balance style with adherence
01 14 Oh my!
01 14 Thank you, Rarity.
01 14 The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
01 14 Wow!
01 14 Oh dear.
01 14 You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...
01 14 Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
01 14 Now what do we do?
01 14 She only has one cat.
01 14 Like you should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
01 14 Maybe not.
01 14 "Dear Princess Celestia. This week my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. And I learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth." 
01 15 Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
01 15 [magic chimes]
01 15 Eyes over here, Spike!
01 15 For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-
01 15 Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
01 15 Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
01 15 Pinkie Pie? What in the wide-wide-world of Equestria are you up to?
01 15 Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.
01 15 Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!
01 15 Of course you did.
01 15 Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?
01 15 C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.
01 15 Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it.
01 15 Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna FA-aaah!
01 15 Oh, please.
01 15 Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.
01 15 Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?
01 15 Huh?  A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 Phhhhft.
01 15 Is your knee pinchy now?
01 15  How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!
01 15 Okay, okay... I get it.
01 15 Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
01 15 Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!
01 15 Combos?
01 15 Yeah, sure.
01 15 Ugh!
01 15 [beeping noises of a truck backing up]
01 15 Ughhh... You said that combo meant 'beautiful rainbow'.
01 15 I don't believe this.
01 15 Hmm...
01 15 Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
01 15 Any twitches yet?
01 15 Now? Anything?
01 15 Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of non-stop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?
01 15 That makes no sense!
01 15 I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
01 15 Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!
01 15 [Pinkie Pie's stomach growls]
01 15 Urgh... You know what?   Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care!
01 15 Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
01 15 Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.
01 15 [frog croaks]
01 15 [frogs croaking]
01 15 Ah!
01 15 Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?
01 15  No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Piecus, in its natural habitat.
01 15 There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Piecus is on the move.
01 15 Hm... Itchy nose...
01 15 A-ha, that makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall out of the sky, but a twitchy tail means that something's about to fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.
01 15 [theremin music]
01 15 [swarm of bees buzzing]
01 15 This proves...
01 15 ...perhaps conclusively, that--
01 15 Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific--
01 15 [swarm buzzing]
01 15 [comical "sting" noises]
01 15 Ow! Ouch! Ow! 
01 15 Smelling a flower.
01 15 Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.
01 15 Oh, ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that-- Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!
01 15 Okay, take this down: twitchy tail.
01 15 Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?
01 15 Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact--
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 Ugh!
01 15 You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?
01 15 Urgh!
01 15 Calm down everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.
01 15 I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
01 15 Cold? Need a jacket or something?
01 15 Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.
01 15 Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... AHA! I told you there was nothing to worry about and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a  doozy, and  and the only  doozy here is how right I am.
01 15 Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but  ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing  in anything you can't see for yourself.
01 15 I see it... But I don't believe it!
01 15 [Hydra roars]
01 15 Pinkie! Come on!
01 15 Everypony up that hill!
01 15 Coming, Spike! Hang on!
01 15 [hydra growls]
01 15 I think we're gonna make it.
01 15 Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!
01 15 No.
01 15 No!
01 15 No small rodents of any kind!
01 15 Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? CHAAARGE!
01 15 [hydra chirps]
01 15 
01 15 I'll never make it!
01 15 I will not!
01 15 [hydra roars]
01 15 
01 15 
01 15 Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
01 15 [ponies cheer]
01 15 I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra--
01 15 Pinkie?
01 15 Huh?
01 15 Huh? But I-- WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
01 15 Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...
01 15 The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
01 15 Eyup, I guess I do.
01 15 What? What is?
01 15 Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.
01 15 Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that-- Spike, what have I been saying about focus?
01 15 What's wrong Spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
01 15 Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
01 15 
01 15 "I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
01 15 "Always, your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
01 15 I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
01 16  Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books guys. It was a crazy week of studying.
01 16 
01 16 What are you two arguing about?
01 16 What's that?
01 16 What's a sonic rainboom?
01 16 Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!
01 16 Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.
01 16 Go on what?
01 16 Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
01 16 Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.
01 16 Ok... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
01 16 Heere goes. [grunts and screams]
01 16 I think it worked!
01 16 I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
01 16 Yes!
01 16 Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.
01 16 Rarity. We're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!
01 16 Rainbow Dash. Are you ok? You don't look so good.
01 16 I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel-rolls in a row can't be easy.
01 16 Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
01 16 
01 16 Princess.
01 16 I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.
01 17 Hello, Fluttershy.
01 17 I'm heading to the Everfree Forest, to Zecora's, to get some of my favorite tea.
01 17 Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
01 17 Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
01 17 What... what happened?
01 17 [chicken squawking]
01 17 This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
01 17 Hmm? How so?
01 17 You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity.
01 17 
01 17 [closing credits]
01 18 What is going on here?
01 18 Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?
01 18 My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
01 18 "Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?
01 18 What do you think they're up to?
01 18 My little ponies! How are you doing?
01 18 Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.
01 18 Oh?
01 18 Oh?
01 18 Costumes?
01 18 Really, girls? Are you sure...
01 18 Break a le...
01 18 Uh... good luck!
01 18 Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.
01 18 Hey, you don't sound too excited.
01 18 Oh, girls...
01 18 Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
01 18 Yes? And...
01 18 Yes? Yes?
01 18 And that is...?
01 18 One day...  One day...
01 18 
01 19 Spike, can you breathe now?
01 19 Good. Now tell us what you know.
01 19 Creepy guys?
01 19 Come on, girls! Let's get started.
01 19 Hello!
01 19 Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
01 19 Oh, Rarity...
01 19  Ooh.
01 19 Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
01 19 Spike, it is very noble of you...
01 19  ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
01 19 Applejack!
01 19 Um... Which way do we go?
01 19 All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
01 19 But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.
01 19 Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
01 19 We're getting close. I can feel it.
01 19 [Rarity crying]
01 19 And just what do you think you're doing?
01 19 Eh... fine. 
01 19 Excuse me?
01 19 I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
01 19 Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
01 20 Oh, doesn't that hurt?
01 20 I promise.
01 20 Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you...
01 20 But...
01 20 My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
01 20 
01 20 She hardly took any pictures.
01 20 Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?
01 20 I'm sure she just got tied up.
01 20 Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
01 20 You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
01 20 Wow! You look great!
01 20 Sorry.
01 20 Feel better?
01 20 Of course.
01 20 I swear.
01 20 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [pokes her eye] AARGH!
01 20 Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...
01 20 [Pinkie Pie disapproves]
01 20 Nothing!
01 20 I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.
01 20 But Rarity told me...
01 20 [Pinkie Pie eats an apple in a menacing way]
01 20 Uhhhhhh..
01 20 I guess you're right.  You're right. You're right, you're fight, you're right!
01 20 Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive on her next fashion show, no one would ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?
01 20 So you do promise or you don't?
01 20 Obviously.
01 20 They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
01 20 But Rarity...! [covers mouth]
01 20 Because you ha...! [covers mouth]
01 20 Of course she did! Because...! [covers mouth]
01 20 But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh! [puts her head into a flower pot]
01 20 Spike has a crush on Rarity! [covers mouth]
01 20 Dear Princess Celestia,
01 20 Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.
01 20 Did you get all that, Spike?
01 20 You're right. That was wrong of me and I'm very sorry.
01 20 Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
01 20 
01 20 
01 21 Uhh... Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
01 21 What's going on?
01 21 Did you say she was a tree?
01 21 Ya know she's not a tree, right?
01 21 Well that was kind of huffy.
01 21 A buffalo stampede!
01 21 They're getting awfully close to the train.
01 21 [all shouting indistinctly]
01 21 And Spike!
01 21 How did you escape from the buffalo?
01 21 Look... Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
01 21 We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt.
01 21 Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we –
01 21 If we could just sit down and talk we could –
01 21  ... Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
01 21 Dear, Princess Celestia. Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care –
01 22 It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.
01 22 I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.
01 22 Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!
01 22 Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.
01 22 And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
01 22 Oh...
01 22  Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.
01 22 Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today...  What is Celestia's pet doing here?!
01 22 Oh no. NonononononoNO! This is bad.
01 22 But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
01 22 Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
01 22 I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return Princess's pet!
01 22 If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. 
01 22 Really? You don't say!
01 22 
01 22 
01 22 [excessive coughing]
01 22 It's that dry night air.
01 22 Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. BYE! Phew... What are you doing?!
01 22 We can't now!
01 22 You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
01 22 Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to.
01 22 Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?
01 22 That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
01 22 Did you give her any kind of medicine?
01 22 Then you have to MAKE her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!
01 22 No excuses!
01 22 Done. Okay, what else?
01 22 There you go.
01 22 Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?
01 22 NEXT!
01 22 One step ahead of you.
01 22 What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
01 22 Oh, she'll eat it, all right.
01 22 Hey! Where are you going?
01 22 Beg your pardon!
01 22 Sorry, but we've gotta find...
01 22 Yes, Your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.
01 22 No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.
01 22 But you were only trying to help.
01 22 Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
01 22 No, it's my fault!
01 22 Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
01 22 Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?
01 23 As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun.
01 23 And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen. I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic. My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam!
01 23 I knew this was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!
01 23 ...yesyesyesyes...
01 23 ...yesyes, YEEEES!
01 23  Um... yes.
01 23 This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!
01 23 Dear Princess Celestia.
01 23 Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
01 23 Just write it, Spike.
01 23 
01 23 
01 24 This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
01 24 You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.
01 24 We better get a move on!
01 24 Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
01 24 Scrolls?
01 24  I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant.
01 24 That is why you are my number one assistant.
01 24 I said... Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot. I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy".
01 24 You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?
01 24 Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
01 24 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 24 I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
01 24 Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
01 24 And a number one assistant, right?
01 24 Spike, that's enough.
01 24 Wow...
01 24 Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?
01 24 Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
01 24 Goodnight, Spike.  Sweet dreams, number one assistant.
01 24 "The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of non-volatile grains and frozen gasses. They..."
01 24 "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
01 24 Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
01 24 Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
01 24 Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?
01 24 Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
01 24 Spike, don't worry.
01 24 It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
01 24 He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
01 24 Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.
01 24 Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
01 24 Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth...
01 24 Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland too".
01 24 Climb down from there before you fall.
01 24 Shoot!
01 24 My last writing quill. It's broken.
01 24 Spike, wait! Wait!
01 24 Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.
01 24 Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
01 24 Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
01 24 Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?
01 24 I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
01 24 Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is NOT the Spike I know and love.
01 24 Spike! Over here!
01 24 Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
01 24 Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
01 24 Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.
01 24 And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.
01 24 He forgives you, Spike.
01 24 It was your ketchup covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
01 24 
01 24 I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
01 24 Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?
01 24 I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
01 24 Oh, Spike.
01 24 Who? Spike! You kno... Oooooh... 
01 24 
01 25 Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie…
01 25 [>Pinkie Pie]
01 25 This is your singing telegram
01 25 I hope it finds you well
01 25 You're invited to a party
01 25 'Cause we think you're really swell
01 25 Gummy's turning one year old
01 25 So help us celebrate
01 25 The cake will be delicious
01 25 The festivities first-rate
01 25 There will be games and dancing
01 25 Bob for apples, cut a rug
01 25 And when the party's over
01 25 We'll gather 'round for a group hug
01 25 No need to bring a gift
01 25 Being there will be enough
01 25 Birthdays mean having fun with friends
01 25 Not getting lots of stuff
01 25 It won't be the same without you
01 25 So we hope that you say yes
01 25 So, please, oh please R.S.V.P
01 25 And come, and be our guest!
01 25 A blast!
01 25 Uh, I think I’m gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon.
01 25 Oh! Hi, Pinki-
01 25 Pardon me?
01 25 “You’re invited to ‘Gummy’s After-Birthday’ party. This afternoon at 3 o’clock.”
01 25 This afternoon? As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
01 25 Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I’ve gotten a bit behind in my studies. I’ve really gotta hit the books.
01 25 Please do.
01 25 I’ll keep that in mind.
01 25 Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
01 25 Good. I don’t wanna her to know anything about this.
01 25 Thanks, and remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie. Hey! What’s with the tin can? 
01 25 I don’t think so.
01 25 Me too.
01 25 [in unison] Surprise!
01 25 Farewell party?
01 25 If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say, “Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie?”
01 25 It’s okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us.
01 25 Huh?!
01 25 Dear Princess Celestia, I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I’m not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
01 25 Yeah, why not? Let’s have a party for Gummy. 
01 25 
01 26 Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.
01 26 Perfect! I'm ready.
01 26 All right, Spike.
01 26 Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
01 26 You have my word.
01 26 Ta-da!
01 26 [collective: Oh. Uh. Ah. That's a choice. Interesting.]
01 26 Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.
01 26 Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
01 26 Oh. Yeah. Right.
01 26 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 26 Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.
01 26 I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!
01 26 At the Gala
01 26 At the Gala (at the Gala), with the Princess (with the Princess)
01 26 Is where I'm going to be (she will be)
01 26 We will talk all about magic and what I've learned and seen (she will see)
01 26 It is going to be so special as she takes time just for me!
01 26 To talk!
01 26 Princess Celestia!
01 26 Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.
01 26 That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
01 26 Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
01 26  Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
01 26 This isn't what I hoped.
01 26 No!
01 26 ...I'm gonna make this...
01 26 Well... it can't get any worse.
01 26 Uh... Eek!
01 26 
01 26 I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
01 26 Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.
01 26 It is?
01 26 You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
01 26 Yes, Spike. You were right.
02 01 Don't worry everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything.
02 01 My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?
02 01 Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky?
02 01 Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth.
02 01 
02 01 You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.
02 01  Come on girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!
02 01 Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could.
02 01 Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there–
02 01 No longer connected?
02 01 But why us? Why don't you-
02 01 Princess Celestia, you can count on–
02 01 Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again.
02 01 The elements! They're gone!
02 01 You seem to know our strengths, too?
02 01 Pinkie!
02 01 Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the elements in the palace labyrinth!
02 01 Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.
02 01 Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
02 01 Give us our wings and horns back!
02 01 Never fear, girls. We have each other!
02 01 All right, girls, let's do this!
02 01 Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!
02 01 Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
02 01 What?
02 01 Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie.
02 01 Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
02 01 Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
02 01 Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
02 01 Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
02 01 Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to every pony.
02 01 [Pinkie blows a raspberry at Twilight]
02 01 Uh...
02 01 What is happening to my friends?
02 01 You're welcome–
02 01 Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
02 01 Now I know that's a lie.  How can it be?
02 01 [thunder, cracking]
02 02 Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could.
02 02 The Elements! They're gone!
02 02 Who are you talking to?
02 02 What? Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
02 02 What is happening to my friends?
02 02 Girls, why are you all acting like this?
02 02 We need to stick together.
02 02 Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair.
02 02 How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
02 02 But...but..
02 02  Think, Twilight, think! "Find the Elements back where you began." Back where you began.
02 02 Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute...home! "Back where you began!" The Elements must be in Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know could give us a clue. Ah!
02 02 Wah! Ahh! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap.
02 02 Ugh.
02 02 I can't picture anything. It's too dark. 
02 02 Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it.
02 02  Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?
02 02 
02 02 Pleeeease, we've gotta hurry!
02 02 Tom?
02 02 You're not going in without him, are you?
02 02  Fine!
02 02 Oh, for the love of...
02 02 Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
02 02 Fluttershy, I've had just about enough... 
02 02 Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret.
02 02 Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!
02 02 Hey! Applejack, give me that book!
02 02 Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
02 02 Hey, do you even know what you just stole?
02 02 [strained groan] Give me that book! Where is she? Where's Rarity?
02 02 Lies!
02 02 [cat yowl, fighting noises]
02 02 Get back! All of you! This is my book. And I'm going to READ IT!  The Elements!
02 02 The Elements! They were here all along!
02 02 See girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!
02 02 You don't even care, do you?
02 02  I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on everypony, let's go!
02 02 Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder and the brute. That just about covers it.
02 02 Congratulations Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!
02 02 Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!
02 02 Move! Look out, here comes Tom!
02 02 
02 02 Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
02 02 Formation, now!
02 02 Rainbow Dash, get over here. All right, let's get this over with.
02 02 What's going on?
02 02 
02 02 Who are you talking to?
02 02 FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...?
02 02 Not anymore...
02 02 Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving.
02 02 Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here.
02 02 These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
02 02 "Real friends don't care what your cover is. Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. And like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through. The best thing to do is stay true to yourself. Everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. Maybe even before she's met them."
02 02 Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Night Mare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!
02 02 You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!
02 02 Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
02 02 Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship.
02 02 Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
02 02 I already have. Come on!
02 02 Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.
02 02 Rainbow Dash!
02 02 We've been looking everywhere for you!
02 02 Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, loyalty!
02 02 Time for Plan B.
02 02 Ugh...
02 02 Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah!
02 02 If you can't catch her, Discord wins!
02 02 Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!
02 02 Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
02 02 Not as wonderful as friendship.
02 02 I'll tell you what we've learned Discord. We've learned that friendship isn't always easy. But there's no doubt it's worth fighting for.
02 02 All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!
02 03 Quill.
02 03 Parchment.
02 03 Extra ink.
02 03 Extra extra ink.
02 03 Is that everything on the checklist?
02 03 Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?
02 03 Item 1: Create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
02 03 How are we doing Spike?
02 03 Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
02 03 Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
02 03 Uh, I only ordered twelve.
02 03 Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?
02 03 It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
02 03 Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!
02 03 Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list. Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
02 03 Almost everything!
02 03 We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
02 03 Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every 10 days, every single week!
02 03 Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!
02 03 When did we send the last one?
02 03 And today is...
02 03 Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!
02 03 Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment.
02 03 I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?
02 03 What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
02 03 What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?!
02 03 She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
02 03 Huh?
02 03 You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
02 03 So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend can help you solve?
02 03  Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
02 03 You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!
02 03 Rarity!
02 03 Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!
02 03 What's happened? Are you alright?
02 03 Never fear Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi--
02 03 So... you just lost your ribbon?
02 03 ...but now you've found it?
02 03 ...and nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend could help you with?
02 03 Yes?
02 03  Measuring tape? Sure.
02 03 No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
02 03 What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! Oh wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.
02 03 Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight. Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack.
02 03 You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
02 03 
02 03 
02 03  I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her.
02 03 Fluttershy?
02 03 How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!
02 03 It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!  It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can. You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
02 03 Huh?
02 03 The picnic! I should go see my friends!
02 03 No! I am not alright.
02 03 It's just terrible.
02 03 Simply awful.
02 03 It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
02 03 My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!
02 03 [strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!
02 03 This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
02 03 [annoyed groans]
02 03 Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!
02 03 [insane giggles]
02 03 Hi girls!
02 03 Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!
02 03 She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!
02 03 I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?
02 03 (thinking) I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think!  That's it! (normal) Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything.
02 03 The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?
02 03 [annoyed groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
02 03 Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?
02 03 Oh no!
02 03 Can't... get... a clear shot! 
02 03 Oh, what have I done?!
02 03 Don't look at it!
02 03 My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
02 03 Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!
02 03 Goodbye girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot.
02 03 ...But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
02 03 Really?
02 03 Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?
02 03 
02 04 I'm Star Swirl the Bearded. Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
02 04 Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.
02 04 Since you moved here from Trottingham?
02 04 Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?
02 04 [bell jingles] Do you like it?
02 04 A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
02 04 
02 04 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 04 Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
02 04 He created more than 200 spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?
02 04 Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?
02 04 Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice.
02 04 Look what you did to Spike.
02 04 Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!
02 04 She means me, Spike.
02 04 
02 04 Princess Luna!
02 04 I'm gonna go talk to her.
02 04 No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good! But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.
02 04 Princess Luna? Hi, my name is-
02 04 Thank you, finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is-
02 04 And that was a good thing, right?
02 04 Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.
02 04 You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.
02 04 Lower the volume..?
02 04 Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice.
02 04 Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!
02 04 [nervous laughter] Wait right here.
02 04 
02 04 Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
02 04 A little quieter, princess.
02 04 Better. Right, Fluttershy?
02 04 Now you're getting it.
02 04 Yes! Well done.
02 04 Come on, princess. Time for plan B.
02 04 My friend Applejack is one of the most likeable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
02 04 Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.
02 04 
02 04 Fire away, princess!
02 04 Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!
02 04 It's not over yet.
02 04 I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
02 04 Princess.
02 04 Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.
02 04 [with regret] Princess...
02 04 No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay?
02 04 There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?
02 04 Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?
02 04 Rainbow!
02 04 She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!
02 04 Huh?
02 04 So why do you keep running away and screaming?
02 04 Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!
02 04 Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
02 04 Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
02 04 Just wait.
02 04 See? They really do like you, princess.
02 04 Dear Princess Celestia,
02 04 When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem - your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!
02 04 
02 06 Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
02 06 Yes, Spike, you're amazing!
02 06 Hay fever... the trots...  Cutie pox!
02 06 Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the paleopony period!
02 06 Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!
02 06 It says here there's no known cure!
02 06 The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!
02 06 She needs help!
02 06 Not some pony... some zebra!
02 06 Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
02 06 Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?
02 07 Well we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except–
02 07 Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection- ugh! And breath mints!
02 07 Aren't those all the same thing?
02 07 Hm, something's not right here.
02 07 Tortoise!
02 07 And he's carrying something on his back...
02 07 Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!
02 07 But what about the--
02 07 Tenacity.
02 08 I can think of a few new words.
02 08 No, but she is kinda awesome.
02 08 [old ponies chattering]
02 08 [splintering wood]
02 08 Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.
02 08 Mm-hm.
02 08 Are you taking notes?
02 08 Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about...
02 08 I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.
02 08 Sounds like somepony's jealous.
02 08 Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.
02 08 And I used my magic to fix the dam.
02 08 Of course we want you to be a hero.
02 08 Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
02 08 What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.
02 08 Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
02 09 When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!
02 09 Is... that my dress?
02 09 It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
02 09 When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot castle ballroom!
02 09 I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
02 09 [ponies chattering]
02 09 (blowing a party trumpet)
02 09 Were you at that other party in the garden?
02 09 Rarity, I'm surprised at you.
02 09 I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
02 09 All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!
02 09 Oh, well you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!
02 09 Understand what?
02 09 Why yes, yes you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.
02 09 I do say. Her name is-
02 09 Oh don't be so modest, this dress you made is beautiful!
02 09 [ponies gasp]
02 09 [glass shattering]
02 09 We all think so!
02 10 No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day. Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... actually, I kinda wanna read that again.
02 10 Spike! What are you laughing at?
02 10 
02 10 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 10 Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
02 10 Start with this one.
02 10 Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!
02 10 Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon.
02 10 Not quite everything.
02 10 It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!
02 10 Never!
02 10 Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away.
02 10 What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
02 10 No problem. See you at home later?
02 10 Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea--
02 10 I can't believe you! Where'd you get all this-- 
02 10 I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
02 10 Spike!
02 10 You went to talk to who?
02 10 Huh?
02 10 
02 10 Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!
02 10 
02 10 This is Spike.  And something's wrong with him.  He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't  his!
02 10 So? What do you think, Doctor?
02 10 That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
02 10  Okay. Thank you, doctor.
02 10 Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.
02 10 [squee, squeaks]
02 10 [watch ticking]
02 10 Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
02 10  You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?
02 10 [laughs nervously]
02 10 Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!
02 10 [sing-song voice] C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!
02 10 Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh Spike, I just re-shelved this room!
02 10 [door closes]
02 10 
02 10  What now?
02 10 Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!
02 10 Help!
02 10 Fluttershy? Fluttershy!?
02 10 What happened?
02 10 That was Spike!
02 10 C'mon, girls!
02 10 Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
02 10 He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
02 11 We're getting closer!
02 11 Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?
02 11 I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane.
02 11 I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
02 11 Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!
02 11 PINKIE!
02 11 Yes, your majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?
02 11 About five minutes, your highness.
02 11 I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
02 11 What's wrong?
02 11 Your highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily.
02 11 
02 11 What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down...
02 11 Look, everypony! The entrance!
02 11 [ice cracking]
02 11  
02 11 [windigo roaring]
02 11 
02 11 They must be... windigos!
02 11 My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!
02 11 And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
02 11 
02 11 [windigo snorts]
02 11 
02 11 Nor do I.
02 11 I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.
02 11 We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
02 11 [wind blowing]
02 13 Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
02 13 And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
02 13 I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.
02 13 Hi! I finished up the work I had to do so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!
02 13 It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.
02 13 Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
02 13 I'm happy to help! It's no trouble-
02 13 [door slams]
02 14 Just do your best, Applejack.
02 14 Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!
02 14 It's from Applejack. “Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville.”
02 14 “...Don't worry, will send money soon.” That's all there is.
02 14 Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
02 14 I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
02 14 This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her.
02 14 Tell us what happened, Applejack!
02 14 Yes ma'am.
02 14 I don't care what she says, Applejack's not telling us something.
02 14 We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
02 14 ...So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town.
02 14 Was the rodeo fun?
02 14 Did you meet some nice ponies there?
02 14 So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
02 14 Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
02 14 Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.
02 14 I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
02 14 Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!
02 14 We'll pay you triple to slow down!
02 14 Rainbow, go back!
02 14 Know what?
02 14 I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!
02 14 Applejack, you're not a failure.
02 14 Nn-nn.
02 15 Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!
02 15 Still worried about Flim and Flam?
02 15 Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!
02 15 Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
02 15 Well, good luck.
02 15 Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?
02 15 Okay everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.
02 15 Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.
02 15 Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.
02 15 Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.
02 15 Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?
02 15 Alright everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!
02 15 Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!
02 15 C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!
02 15 We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!
02 15 I'm proud of you, Applejack.
02 15 Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
02 15 That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
02 16 Hey Rarity, hey Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?
02 16 
02 16 Oh no, oh no, oh no!
02 16 Ohh.
02 16 How is she, doctor?
02 16 This is the first story in the series. I own all of them. 
02 16 Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!
02 16 I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.
02 16 [door closes]
02 16 [clock ticking]
02 16 [ball bouncing]
02 16 [glass clinking, sloshing etc]
02 16 [light clicking]
02 16 Hi Rainbow Dash!
02 16 We brought your favorite board game!
02 16 You go first, Rainbow Dash!
02 16 Alright, uh... cloud three.
02 16 Uh... cloud two?
02 16 But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game of-
02 16 But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
02 16 Alright then.
02 16 [door closes]
02 16 What's going on, Rainbow Dash?
02 16 -'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
02 16 Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
02 16 Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.
02 16 Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!
02 16 Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!
02 16 Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
02 16 That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess.
02 17 Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry.
02 17 I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
02 17 That's right. It even has the recipe.
02 17 Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll–
02 18 I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered.
02 18 Rainbow!
02 20 Oh, hi Spike!
02 20 Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!
02 20 It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
02 20 Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
02 20 No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!
02 20 Oh my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read The Art of Invisibility Spells, and Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?
02 20 [magic crackling, wind blowing]
02 20 What's going on? 
02 20 Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two 'me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
02 20 You're from the future?!
02 20 What happened to you? The future must be awful.
02 20 Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
02 20 I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
02 20 Really? Where? I've never seen them.
02 20 Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions- [muffled voice]
02 20 Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I... will be...  She must want me to prevent whatever horrible thing happens in the future! 
02 20 Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!
02 20 This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
02 20 I've just been visited by myself from the future!
02 20 This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
02 20 I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
02 20 We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything.
02 20 Everypony else-
02 20 Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!
02 20 [cement squelching]
02 20 [screw squeaking]
02 20 Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?
02 20 Great.
02 20 Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
02 20 [Cerberus roaring]
02 20 That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus, but if he's here, then all of the evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!
02 20 Yeah, isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!
02 20 [Cerberus roaring]
02 20 Huh?
02 20 Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing.
02 20 Pinkie.
02 20 Do you have a ball I can borrow?
02 20 [sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!
02 20 [Cerberus panting]
02 20 I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.
02 20 [cockerel crowing]
02 20 Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
02 20  Oh no!
02 20 It's not that, it's this!
02 20 The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
02 20 If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?
02 20 I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!
02 20 I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... maybe it's what I don't do! If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!
02 20 [through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!
02 20 
02 20 What happened?
02 20 Show me.
02 20 Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
02 20 I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!
02 20 What's this?
02 20 Madame Pinkie?
02 20 Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.
02 20 Yes, and?
02 20 Are you sure?
02 20 Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!
02 20 Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
02 20 Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine and quarter catadioptric telescopes?
02 20 So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head, see the bandage, just like the bandage from the future...
02 20 I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything.
02 20 That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong!
02 20 Oh I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!
02 20  Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine and quarter inch catadioptric telescopes?
02 20 Ah! My eye!
02 20 The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time.
02 20 [train chugging]
02 20  Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!
02 20  Guard! C'mon, you guys!  That was close.
02 20  No, there's nothing fun about this!
02 20  Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!
02 20  No, it's not fun!
02 20  The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can- AH!
02 20  Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here.
02 20  What is it, Spike?
02 20 I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
02 20 Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
02 20  What do we do, what do we do?!
02 20 [chuckles nervously] Thanks!
02 20 Oh no!
02 20 
02 20 Look! I look just like future Twilight... the last sign has come true!
02 20 Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
02 20 I. Don't. Know!
02 20 [birds singing]
02 20 Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!
02 20 Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
02 20  I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
02 20 
02 20 And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!
02 20 No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.
02 20 Pinkie, you're a genius!
02 20 Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
02 20 [magic crackling]
02 20 Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
02 20 Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
02 20 That's right, now listen-
02 20 Please! I don't have much time!
02 20 Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
02 20 The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not-
02 20 They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to-
02 20 I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't-
02 20 [magic crackling]
02 20 -waste your time... worrying... about... ugh, I can't believe I just did that.
02 20 Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
02 20  Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.
02 20 
02 20 Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home.
02 20 
02 21 [digging sounds]
02 21 C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!
02 21 But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
02 21 Aw Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.
02 21 Well... yeah!
02 21 
02 21  I don't see any dragons.
02 21  No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!
02 21  You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?
02 21 Wow, amazing!
02 21 Or act like them.
02 21 Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you, or where they found you.
02 21 I'm sorry, Spike.
02 21 Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.
02 21 Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
02 21 Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
02 21 I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!
02 21 Aw, Spike.
02 21 That sounds great. I'm famished.
02 21 What?!?
02 21 Hold it!
02 21 Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you.
02 21 We know.
02 21 Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.
02 21 Quest.
02 21 We have faith in you!
02 21 [through her grin] Of course.
02 21 [wind blowing]
02 21 [rain pouring]
02 21 [dragon roaring]
02 21 [teacup clinking]
02 21 [sounds of exertion]
02 21 Shh!  We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!
02 21 [dragons cheering]
02 21 [deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
02 21  How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
02 21 I know, I know!
02 21 There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
02 21 Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
02 21 Oof!
02 21 [pinching noise]
02 21  Spike's on his own this time.
02 21 [dragons cheering]
02 21 Forever?!
02 21 Oh no, this is terrible!
02 21 No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!
02 21  Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!
02 21 Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
02 21 That's right!
02 21 Nyuh!
02 21 
02 21 Of course. What are friends for?
02 22 This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H<sub>2</sub>O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?
02 22 Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment.
02 22 We have 9.3 wing power.
02 22 16.5 wing power!
02 22 [hushed, to Rainbow Dash] Tell her!
02 22  No, you!
02 22 That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday.
02 22 Do I look like I speak squirrel?
02 22 Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!
02 22 Let's see, with those eight sick pegasi out with the feather flu...  oh no!
02 22 No...
02 22 ...you might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
02 22 [taps giant anemometer]
02 22 I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
02 22 [water churning]
02 22 Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
02 22 Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
02 22 She could sure use it, considering eight pegasi are sick with the feather flu!
02 22 Are you okay?
02 22 Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
02 22 But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
02 22 If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!
02 22 Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred... five hundred!
02 22 Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
02 22 Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!
02 22 You can make a difference!
02 22 Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
02 22 It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
02 22 She did it! She did it! They all did it!
02 23 I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
02 23 Celestia, just like us? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
02 23 I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
02 23 Listen to this one. “Twilight Sparkle: I was a Canterlot snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes.” Spike!
02 23 How could you say such a thing?
02 23 But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants, she doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! “Fluttershy has tail extensions!” “Pinkie Pie is an out-of-control party animal!”
02 23 Oh look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!
02 23 “Rainbow Dash: Speed demon or super softie?”?!
02 23 See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!
02 23 We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is!
02 24 Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
02 24 Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
02 24 Well it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep.
02 24 Pinkie... you're overreacting.
02 24 Whoa!
02 24 Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet Pinkie... look.
02 24 You mean, who "did it."
02 24 Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate.
02 24 Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?
02 24 Yes?
02 24 Pinkie, how could you possibly know?
02 24 But it makes no sense!
02 24 Well first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?
02 24 And second, the cake hasn't been sliced, it's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!
02 24 Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system. And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!
02 24 May be?
02 24 Pinkie... that mousse is a moose!
02 24 So you're saying that the culprit is...
02 24 Pinkie stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!
02 24 Thank you!
02 24 Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.
02 24 No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
02 24 Good... let's retrace your steps.
02 24 Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it Pinkie.
02 24 Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.
02 24 The conductor, huh?  But, that doesn't make any sense. What happened next Pinkie?
02 24 Yes?
02 24 Interesting. Anything else?
02 24 Oh my, what is that?
02 24 
02 24 [teapot whistling]
02 24 What next Pinkie?
02 24 And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?
02 24 By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.
02 24 I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
02 24 We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
02 24 Well you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like this.
02 24 Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.
02 24 No Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?
02 24 Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.
02 24 Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was, Fluttershy.
02 24 Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?
02 24 Really?
02 24 But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.
02 24 Well, yes I do. Do you?
02 24 Well Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?
02 24 What do you say bakers?
02 24 Well everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.
02 24 Care for a bite?
02 25 Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot. [to the others] Wedding?  I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.
02 25 Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.
02 25 Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.
02 25 Rainbow Dash-
02 25 ...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their I do's.
02 25 Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.
02 25 And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?
02 25 Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...  My brother?!
02 25 [<a href="/wiki/Theme_song" title="Theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
02 25 Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as >Shining Armor] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation.  Princess Mi Amore Cadenza? Who in the hoof is that?! 
02 25 Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F!
02 25 
02 25 Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
02 25 Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I really accepted as a friend.
02 25 When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly
02 25 To see how many other ponies I could meet
02 25 I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need
02 25 Other ponies to make my life complete
02 25 But there was one colt that I cared for
02 25 I knew he would be there for me
02 25 My big brother, best friend forever!
02 25 Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together
02 25 He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!)
02 25 We never had a single fight (We did everything together!)
02 25 We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
02 25 I miss him more than I realized
02 25 It seems...
02 25 And though he's, oh, so far away
02 25 I hoped that he would stay
02 25 My big brother best friend
02 25 Forever...
02 25 Forever...
02 25 He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be Captain of the Royal Guard.
02 25 I guess we are.
02 25 I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Cal-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other.
02 25 Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
02 25 Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
02 25 I've got something to say to you, mister.
02 25 How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister for pony's sake!
02 25 Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?
02 25 Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?
02 25 You want me to be your best mare?
02 25 I'd be honored!  But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?
02 25 Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
02 25 Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
02 25 How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
02 25 Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!
02 25 Cadance, it's me, Twilight!
02 25 Mmm. Check.
02 25  Did... you see what she...
02 25 Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
02 25 Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants."
02 25 
02 25 Bet I can guess what you're all thinking! Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
02 25 Rarity, she was so demanding!
02 25 Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres she threw them in the trash?
02 25 No, she was just being fake, and totally insincere!
02 25 See? Rude!
02 25 Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated-
02 25 Nevermind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?
02 25 
02 25 And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor let alone marry him!
02 25 I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!
02 25 
02 25 We need to talk. I think you're making a big-
02 25 She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
02 25 She isn't just unpleasant and rude, she's downright evil!
02 25 Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help-
02 25 Dresses? What are you-?
02 25 "New" bridesmaids? What happened to her "old" bridesmaids?
02 25 Looks like I really am on my own.
02 25 [church organ music]
02 25 I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her. And neither should you!
02 25 You have to listen to me!
02 25 I'm fine.
02 25 I've got something to say! She's evil!
02 25 She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
02 25 Because you're evil!
02 25 Evil! And if I don't stop you you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
02 25 
02 25 
02 25 I was just trying to-
02 25 I was-
02 25 Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
02 25 He was my big brother, best friend
02 25 Forever...
02 25 And now, we'll never do anything
02 25 Together...
02 25 [smashing noise]
02 25 I'm sorry!
02 26 "Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."  my brother?
02 26 How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
02 26 But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
02 26 Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
02 26 Cadance, it's me! Twilight!
02 26 She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells tingling]...
02 26 I just lost a brother. I'm sorry.
02 26  Hello? Is anyone there?
02 26 
02 26 Where am I?
02 26 Help! Help!
02 26 Plans? What plans?
02 26 Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!
02 26 Likely story! 
02 26 ...and do a little shake.
02 26 You remember me!
02 26 We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
02 26 We will. We just have to find... there!
02 26 Stop!
02 26 
02 26 Princess Celestia!
02 26 Rarity!
02 26 Go, go!
02 26 They're changelings, remember?
02 26 Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
02 26 It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
02 26 Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
02 26 [electric sounds]
02 26 Your spell! Perform your spell!
02 26 Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the Changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?
02 26 Love is in bloom
02 26 A beautiful bride, a handsome groom,
02 26 Two hearts becoming one
02 26 A bond that cannot be undone because
02 26 Love is in bloom
02 26 A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
02 26 I said love is in bloom
02 26 You're starting a life and making room
02 26 For us (For us, For us....)
02 26 Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
02 26 Now this was a great wedding.
03 01 Where are all my quills? No, no, no, no, no...ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes 1-36! Where is it? Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me on everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards.
03 01 Just a test? JUST A TEST? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!
03 01 Ahem.
03 01 You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills. And plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry! Sorry!
03 01 The Crystal Empire? I-I'm sorry, I thought I'd studied. I don't think there's anything in any of my books--
03 01 You want me to help protect an entire empire?
03 01 How do I begin?
03 01 My brother is there?
03 01 But what if I fail?
03 01 But what if--
03 01 Mm-hm.
03 01 I was prepared to do my best
03 01 Thought I could handle any test
03 01 For I can do so many tricks
03 01 But I wasn't prepared for this
03 01 Levitation would have been a breeze
03 01 Facts and figures I recite with ease
03 01 The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
03 01 I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss
03 01 But I wasn't prepared for this
03 01 Will I fail, or will I pass?
03 01 I can't be sure...
03 01 My mind is sharp, my skills intact
03 01 My heart is pure...
03 01 Oh, I've taken my share of licks
03 01 I've made it through the thin and thick
03 01 But no I wasn't
03 01 Oh no, I wasn't
03 01 No I wasn't
03 01 Prepared... for this!
03 01 Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire!
03 01 Are you sure? Absolutely sure?
03 01 King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
03 01 Yes.
03 01 If you think of anything, even the smallest thing...
03 01 Maybe the others are having better luck.
03 01 C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together!
03 01 Princess Cadance needs our help
03 01 Her magic will not last forever
03 01 I think we can do it
03 01 But we need to work together
03 01 We have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 And the Crystal Kingdom anthem
03 01 Can you learn it in a day?
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
03 01 It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you!
