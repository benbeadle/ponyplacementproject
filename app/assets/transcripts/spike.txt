01 01 Ow!
01 01 [groan]
01 01 Well, it was a gift for Moondancer, but...
01 01 [squeak]
01 01 But we're on a break!
01 01 It's over here!
01 01 [whack]
01 01 Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
01 01 No- whoa!
01 01 [smack]
01 01 Ow!
01 01 Okie dokie.
01 01 Hold on. Preci... preci...
01 01 Threh...
01 01 Twilight Sparkle. Got it!
01 01 Now?
01 01 Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow.
01 01 Impera... impera...
01 01 Whoa!
01 01 [crunch]
01 01 Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath...
01 01 [belch]
01 01 [clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.
01 01 ...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
01 01 My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!
01 01 Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?
01 01 Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said?
01 01 Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!
01 01 [sigh]
01 01 Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres.
01 01 [snickering]
01 01 Food's all taken care of, next is weather.
01 01 Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
01 01 [bursts out laughing]
01 01 Wow, she's amazing! [laughs]
01 01 Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
01 01 Decorations. Beautiful...
01 01 Not the decor, her!
01 01 How are my spines? Are they straight?
01 01 [sigh]
01 01 Wasn't she wonderful?
01 01 [clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!
01 01 [distant birdsong fanfare]
01 01 Well, well, well...!
01 01 I'm Spike.
01 01 Well, what do you wanna know?
01 01 Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
01 01 ...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?
01 01 Gyah!
01 01 No I don't- whoa!
01 01 Huh. Rude much?
01 01 "Hot sauce". Ooh...
01 01 Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting "pin the tail on the pony"! Wanna play?
01 01 It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!
01 01 C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!
01 01 [sigh]
01 02 But that's just an old ponies' tale.
01 02 My Dear Twilight. There is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends.
01 02 Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!...
01 03 No. Nope. Nope--
01 03 I know, right?
01 03 Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time.
01 03 Nope. Worm. A-ha!
01 03 What? [burp]
01 03 [clears throat] Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce The Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.
01 03 [burp] Look, two tickets.
01 03 No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.
01 03 So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?
01 03 Hey!
01 03 Twilight, he just wants to take your order.
01 03 Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy.
01 03 I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
01 03 Oh. You're still on that?
01 03 D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!
01 03 Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk, see you back at the library.
01 03 What are we gonna do?
01 03 Ugh, warn me next time you're gonna do that.
01 03 [gasp]
01 03 Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...
01 03 [burp]
01 03 "My faithful student Twilight,
01 03 Why didn't you just say so in the first place?" Six tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala.
01 03 [ponies gasp]
01 03 How come I don't get a ticket to the gala? Hurk! [burp] "And one for you, Spike." [giggles] I mean, gross, I have to go too?
01 04 Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh.
01 04 Awkward.
01 04 [sniff]
01 04 [chomp] Want one?
01 04 And I've got the perfect treat.
01 04 From the trash.
01 04 [ponies, in unison: EW]
01 04 Just a little nibble? Come on.
01 04 [ponies: ew; gross]
01 04 [music]
01 04 [credits]
01 05 [humming]
01 05 [thunder]
01 05 D-aah! [hiccups]
01 05 [chuckles] Good one, Pinkie [hiccup] Pie. [hiccup] You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup] on me. [hiccup] Nnaa--
01 05 Ne--[hiccup]--eh, don't be [hiccup] silly, dragons are [hiccup] fire-proof.
01 05 I wish the same thing [hiccup] were true with scrolls.
01 05 [hiccups]
01 05 Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.
01 05 Hey, can I blow out the candles?
01 05 Ugh.
01 05 [laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic.
01 05 Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing.
01 05 What? It's great, try some.
01 05 Wow, talk about a party pooper.
01 06 Come on, Twilight, you can do it!
01 06 Ha ha! Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number twenty-five. Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting. And I think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache. [laughter]
01 06 Wait! Aw, rats.
01 06 Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents.
01 06 Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.
01 06 Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
01 06 Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?
01 06 Whoa!
01 06 Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.
01 06 Come on, no pony's as magical as Twi-- Twi-- Twi-- Oh! [clears throat] Hey, Rarity, I, uh-- Mustache!
01 06 Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is--
01 06 What? What's wrong?
01 06 How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi-- [zip!] Mmph! M-mmph!
01 06 [zip] Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta! [cries]
01 06 You show her, AJ!
01 06 What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.
01 06 Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's--
01 06 It's green. What?
01 06 Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of.
01 06 Yes, you are! You're better than her!
01 06 Twilight?
01 06 What are you two doin'?
01 06 The what?
01 06 Sheesh.
01 06 How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who--
01 06 Oh really? Were you guys actually there?
01 06 But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.
01 06 Look, unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!
01 06 Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?
01 06 It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!
01 06 Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.
01 06 But you're the best!
01 06 [sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine.
01 06 [door slam, door open]
01 06 [spooky music and sounds]
01 06 Hey, guys, where ya goin'?
01 06 Huh?
01 06 Twilight!
01 06 [banging on door]
01 06 Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
01 06 No, you don't understand, it's--
01 06 [roar]
01 06 Majorly.
01 06 Nice use of number sixteen.
01 06 [metallic sounds]
01 06 [water flowing]
01 06 [milking sounds and moos]
01 06 That's new.
01 06 [metallic clank]
01 06 That was amazing!
01 06 Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that Ursa Major?
01 06 So it is possible to vanquish an Ursa Major all by yourself?
01 06 Well, if that was an Ursa Minor, then what's an Ursa Major like?
01 06 Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.
01 06 Sweet!
01 06 So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?
01 06 Eh, she didn't go for the mustache.
01 06 Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
01 06 Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no a soulpatch right on my chin!
01 06 [music]
01 06 [credits]
01 07 You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait!
01 07 [pant] I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?
01 07 [sigh] With pleasure.
01 09 Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
01 09 Is it some sort of pony holiday?
01 09 Does my breath stink? [belch]
01 09 Is it... zombies?!
01 09 Not likely... but possible?
01 09 Who?! The zombie pony?
01 09 Uh, sorry.
01 09 Will do!
01 09 A curse!
01 09 How about this one?
01 09 But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a-
01 09 A purse? How could it be a purse?
01 09 Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
01 09 This is hilarious! [laughs] Look at all of you! We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'.... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that.
01 09 [groan]
01 09 [giggle]
01 09 Nope! Uh... gotta stay her and look for a cure. [gasp] Twilight Flopple!
01 10 It also didn't mess itself up.
01 10 I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
01 10 Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time--wooah hoaw! Aw.
01 10 You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
01 10 Or maybe I should... [groan]
01 10 [ponies chatter]
01 10 [snore]
01 10 Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
01 10 I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
01 10 Ugh.
01 10 Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".
01 10 Help!
01 10 Help...
01 11 [snore]
01 11 Huh? Mommy?
01 11 You're not mommy.
01 11 Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
01 11 It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.
01 11 I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blanket, which I think I hear calling my name. "Spike! Spike! Come to bed!" Ugh, it's too early.
01 11 I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'. [snore]
01 11 That nest needs to be condemned.
01 11 An outhouse?
01 11 I think we lost her.
01 11 What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
01 11 Now get out there.
01 11 Pwuh.
01 11 Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight. A natural disaster. [laughter]
01 11 [chuckles]
01 11 [chuckles]
01 11 Uh, what's "hibernation"?
01 11 Long sleep?
01 11 I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the "eat less food" part.
01 11 Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?
01 11 Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
01 11 Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
01 11 That's my girl, following my advice.
01 11 O... Whoa-oa-oa
01 11 The nerve. Can you believe her?
01 11 Come on, Twilight. Come on out.
01 11 Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.
01 11 That's what I'm here for, sister.
01 11 Eh, yes ma'am.
01 11 [snore]
01 13 Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!
01 13 Um... Uh, them! Let the games begin!
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 17 seconds.
01 13 But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
01 13 18 seconds!
01 13 Why me?
01 13 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch.
01 13 No.
01 13 Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa
01 13 And I lose.
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 [grunt] How do I get roped into these things?
01 13 Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point our competitors are tied at 5 and 5.
01 13 Them!
01 13 [crowd chatters]
01 13 Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
01 13 Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.
01 13 Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--
01 13 Um... Pinkie Pie?
01 13 Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering...
01 13 Aw... Forget it.
01 13 We could?
01 13 Get set.
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.
01 13 You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic.
01 13 Yes it... does. What?
01 13 So... no fudge?
01 13 Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!
01 13 I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.
01 13 Oookay... Let's get back to the race.
01 13 And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
01 13 Uh... I... like... pickles?
01 13 As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.
01 13 There aren't even any trees.
01 13 With the most interesting announcing.
01 13 Oh no, she di'int!
01 13 You tied!
01 14 You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
01 14 Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!
01 14 Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
01 14 Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries! ...for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!
01 14 Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity!
01 15 Uh, sorry.
01 15 Nyuh!
01 15 I can't help it. Look!
01 15 [several sound effects]
01 15 Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
01 15 [Eerie music plays]
01 15 Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!
01 15 Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?
01 15 Ha ha! That was amazing!
01 15 Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!
01 15 Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true.
01 15 Nyuh! What does that mean?!
01 15 Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?
01 15 Twilight? What are ya doing back there?
01 15 Plan what?
01 15 Twilight?
01 15 Woah-oh-uh!
01 15 Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?
01 15 Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!
01 15 [gasp]
01 15 Gah!
01 15 What's she doing now?
01 15 Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?
01 15 Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"!
01 15 Here, let me help you.
01 15 Twitchy tail? [gasp] TWITCHY-TAIL!
01 15 [theremin music, growing louder]
01 15 Someone's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!
01 15 Tail... still twitching?
01 15 Oh no! What does that one mean?
01 15 Oh no! Is it about her?
01 15 Guh-- Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
01 15 So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
01 15 I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?
01 15 Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it, anyway. Like, what if, she exploded?
01 15 Yeah, like. boom!
01 15 I know.
01 15 Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
01 15 But, what if, she exploded, and exploded again, and then-- ugh!
01 15 Fluttershy! You're okay!
01 15 W-well t-then s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!
01 15 [Hydra growls]
01 15 He-e-elp!
01 15 But Pinkie's still shuddering!
01 15 Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?
01 15 How about a squirrel?
01 15 How 'bout--
01 15 That's too bad.
01 15 Woah-ho!
01 15 What wasn't what?
01 15 Give what up, Twi?
01 15 Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
01 15 With pleasure, Twilight.
01 15 I know, but I... Well...
01 15 Not really, no.
01 15 Honk.
01 15 Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole!
01 15 [music]
01 15 [credits]
01 18 I had nothing to do with this.
01 18 Huh. I should think not. What?
01 18 I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.
01 19 Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous, talented and-heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and...
01 19 Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!
01 19 Did you find some?
01 19 Ooooo! You look so delicious...
01 19 Hm... I will miss you, my sweets.
01 19 At your service, my lady.
01 19 No. It's perfect.
01 19 For me. From Rarity.
01 19 Coming!
01 19 Jackpot!
01 19 Ehe...
01 19 Run, Rarity! Run!
01 19 Got him, Rarity! I got him!
01 19 Wait! Rarity?
01 19 [gasp] Rarity!
01 19 Which, what, where?
01 19 Nooooooooooo!!!
01 19 Yes... [pant] I think so.
01 19 Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her!
01 19 Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
01 19 They called themselves the diamond dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
01 19 I got it! I'll save you, my sweet.
01 19 Shhh!
01 19 Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.
01 19 Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!
01 19 Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!
01 19 Nooooooooooo!
01 19 I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
01 19 No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell.
01 19 That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on.
01 19 It's coming from down here. Come on!
01 19 I'm coming for you, my lady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!
01 19 Please, Twilight. Just give me this.
01 19 Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!
01 19 [Dogs' screams: Please, take us! Make it Stop! Please!]
01 19 Rarity! You're safe!
01 19 You're letting us leave with all these... jewels?
01 19 Hm... "Outshines" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores's costumes.
01 20 Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
01 20 I have a crush on Rarity!
01 20 You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.
01 20 No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
01 20 Apology accepted.
01 20 I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.
01 21 [groan] Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!
01 21 Okay, fine...
01 21 Good Night!
01 21 Oh for pete's sake!
01 21 Bloomberg..? Bloomberg? Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit. Good night. [sigh]
01 21 [indistinct surprise: >Rainbow Dash
01 21 Who gets what now, huh?]
01 21 Heeeelp!
01 21 [distant] Heeeelp!
01 21 Stop!
01 21 Dash, Pinkie... 'Sup? Hey, no worries I know those guys. They're cool.
01 21 Seems they took me by mistake.. And they feel awful about it, too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.
01 21 Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool.
01 21 Turquoise. Mmm! [munching] Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.
01 21 I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
01 21 See Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason ta –
01 21 All right, Pinkie Pie! That was FANTASTIC! What a great song! You're right on!
01 21 Isn't there someway to stop this?
01 21 [sigh] [munching]
01 21 I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week. [chomp] Auhh...!
01 23 Gross! When did you get so cheesy?
01 24 Awesome!
01 24 A centennial celebration!
01 24 Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Huh. There.
01 24 Check!
01 24 Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch and my freshly baked home-made triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
01 24 I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
01 24 Missed that! Huh...?
01 24 The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
01 24 Right. Check!
01 24 Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!
01 24 Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
01 24 Check!
01 24 Oh, come on. [pause] I said come on.
01 24 Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. [pause] Twilight, your turn.
01 24 All right. That's enough.
01 24 Wow...
01 24 [yawn] Huh?
01 24 [snore]
01 24 [snore] Waah! I overslept! I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast. Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight. And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?
01 24 But my morning chores...
01 24 Who?
01 24 Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...
01 24 Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried?
01 24 Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me...
01 24 Owlowiscious: Hoo.
01 24 Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?
01 24 I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
01 24 Who?
01 24 I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
01 24 Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?
01 24 So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know? [crash] Well, not really, but... You know what I mean!
01 24 That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!
01 24 [mocking] "He's just wonderful." Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer.
01 24 They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one...
01 24 ...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is.
01 24 Hey!
01 24 Yes, sir!
01 24 Never fear, Spike, your number one assistant, is here.
01 24 [under his breath] Quill... quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...?
01 24 Where am I gonna get a quill?
01 24 But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things!
01 24 Not a quince. A quill!
01 24 Not a quiche. [pronounced correctly] A quill!
01 24 [sigh] Shoot.
01 24 Come on, chicken! Here, chicky chicky chicky! Here, chick chick chick chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here!
01 24 Spike... to the rescue.
01 24 That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?
01 24 Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finish–
01 24 Huh?
01 24 Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
01 24 [to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game.
01 24 Not "who"! Two! Urgh!
01 24 Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how? [mouse squeaking] Ah...
01 24 Muahahaha!
01 24 So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!
01 24 [evil laugh]
01 24 That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?
01 24 She... She doesn't love me anymore.
01 24 Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse? [starts raining] I guess that's a yes.
01 24 Hello? Hello? What is that?
01 24 If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!
01 24 Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here.
01 24 Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?
01 24 Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?
01 24 You don't scare me! So you're big. Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!
01 24 Am I glad to see you!
01 24 I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
01 24 I'm sorry, Twilight. I've never should have been so jealous.
01 24 And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
01 24 Me. Forgive me, Spike.
01 24 Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
01 24 Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it?
01 24 Uh... [nervous giggle]
01 24 I'm ready when you are.
01 24 Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!
01 24 Dear Princess Celestia, this is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will... [drops asleep]
01 25 [grunts] Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?
01 25 [sigh]
01 25 Wow! Nice spread!
01 25 That’s it? Oh, you got it. Okay… uh, beautiful weather we’re having, eh? I love sunny spring day, don’t you? The birds chirpin’ and the flowers bloomin’.
01 25 Oh? Okay. Let’s see, there’s Twilight Sparkle. She’s a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knock-out. Twilight seems to think I don’t even have a chance with her, but… eh, what does she know? Let’s see. There’s… there’s Fluttershy, a Pegasus who’s afraid of heights. Heh, what’s up with that?
01 25 Confess?
01 25 I’m the one who spilled juice all over Twilight’s copy of Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions!
01 25 And I’m the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
01 25 And sometimes… when no one’s around… I do this: Lookin’ good, Spike! Lookin’ real good!
01 25 W-What you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I’ll say it!
01 25 Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you ’cause they don’t like your parties and they don’t want to be your friends anymore!
01 25 Uh… so... [loud eating noises]
01 26 She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
01 26 Shh! Watch!
01 26 [collective: Oh! Wow! Lovely!]
01 26 Come on, you guys. Let me in!
01 26 I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our home town, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!
01 26 Oh. Okay.
01 26 Great! Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels. And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop. Then let's get moving! Hyah!
01 26 Um... I...
01 26 Wow! You all look... amazing!
01 26 Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever. You know why? Cause we're all gonna spend time at the Gala to... gether. Or not.
01 26 Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
01 26 Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
01 26 Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever?
01 26 That sounds like the worst night ever!
01 26 You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
02 01 Uh, give up?
02 01 [burp]
02 02 [snore] Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy?
02 02 I...uh...huh?
02 02 [crash]
02 02 Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so...gray?
02 02 What's happened to everypony?
02 02 The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it!
02 02 This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
02 02 But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?
02 02 But what about Rainbow Dash?
02 02 Me? B-b-but what if she finds out I've been impersonating her? [moan] That won't end well.
02 02 Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all this- whoa!
02 02 [groan]
02 02 Can't...move. The princess...has been sending these...since I came back upstairs. [belch] Make it stop!
02 02 [groan] [belch]
02 02 [moaning]

02 03 Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationary shop...
02 03 Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
02 03 Cupcakes!
02 03 Whoa...
02 03 Uhhh-no!
02 03 Eh.
02 03 Looks like that's everything!
02 03 Triple check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist! Uh... check! Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!
02 03 Why? Is that bad?
02 03 Huh?
02 03 Where it.. always is?
02 03 Last... Tuesday?
02 03 Tuesday?
02 03 What's that now?
02 03 Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.
02 03 Yeah... I don't think she--
02 03 Why would she--
02 03 Well, why wouldn't you pass--
02 03 Twilight? Twilight!
02 03 That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
02 03 [sighs]
02 03 Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.
02 03 [sighs] This won't end well..
02 03 Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?
02 03 Snap out of it!
02 03 Are you okay?
02 03 Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with--
02 03 I'm glad you've come to your senses.
02 03 P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um...

02 04 Uh.. [knocking] That sounds important.
02 04 It's a great costume... grandpa.
02 04 Mhmm! [eating noises] I'll love it.

02 06 Yes, well, I do have some talents.
02 06 Cutie pox?!
02 06 Heh, say that ten times fast!
02 06 No known cure?!
02 06 No, she's not.
02 06 She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
02 06 Ready!
02 07 Rainbow!
02 07 Huh. Way to go, little guy!
02 07 What's the matter?
02 08 That day.
02 08 Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!
02 08 Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
02 08 The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 She's... great.
02 08 Rainbow Dash is jealous.
02 08 Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
02 08 Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.
02 08 Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!
02 08 [clears throat] Dear Princess Cel-
02 08 [yelping and screaming]
02 10 [chuckling]
02 10 This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!
02 10 [tuning fork ping]
02 10 [giggles] Hey, you took my advice! Just use the whole floor as one big shelf.
02 10 And totally delicious.
02 10 Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner.
02 10 Gosh... you really like it, huh?
02 10 [sighs] Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
02 10 I will never wash this cheek again. [sighs and laughs]
02 10 There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect!
02 10 A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight. I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!
02 10 [gasps for breath] It's mine! Stop it!
02 10 Twilight...!
02 10 Are those... for me?
02 10 Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book.
02 10 [sheep bleating]
02 10 Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one.
02 10 I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever.
02 10 [balloon pops]
02 10 No way!
02 10 Hi, Mr and Mrs Cake!
02 10 Thanks!
02 10 Wow!
02 10 Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!
02 10 [chomps] [muffled] Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today.
02 10 Wow, really?
02 10 I wish every day was my birthday...
02 10 Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat.
02 10 [ball bouncing]
02 10 Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday?
02 10 [ball bouncing]
02 10 [laughs] This is unbelievable! [chuckles] Hey Junebug! It's my birthday!
02 10 Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present?
02 10 Well how about those flowers? I'll take those--
02 10 Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back.
02 10 Sounds good! Bye! [chuckles] Who else has a present for 'Spikey-wikey'? [hisses]
02 10 [snoring]
02 10 [yawns/hisses] What happened?
02 10 What's happening to me, Twilight?!
02 10 I went to talk... to...
02 10 Huh?
02 10 Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?
02 10 What about this book?
02 10 My arms aren't usually [voice drops] this long either. What's happening to me?

02 10 Proud of me?
02 10 Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.
02 10 [kiss]
02 10 [credits]
02 11 [train whistle]
02 11 Curtain in two minutes!
02 11 [sighs]
02 11 [with a faux British accent] Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart, by hatred.
02 11 [normal voice] I know. Can you believe it? [accent] During this frightful age, each of the three tribes, the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies, cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But, they demanded something in return. Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies.
02 11 [accent] The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.
02 11 [accent] The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
02 11 [wind blowing]
02 11 [accent] The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.
02 11 [accent] Each tribe sent their leaders.
02 11 [fanfare]
02 11 [accent] Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.
02 11 [fanfare]
02 11 [accent] Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly...
02 11 [fanfare with kazoos]
02 11 [accent] ...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster.
02 11 [accent] And the blizzard raged on.
02 11 [accent] So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain.
02 11 [accent] And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before.
02 11 [accent] And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow, and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead of-
02 11 [laughs nervously] [clears throat] [accent] Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.
02 11 [accent] All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today. Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw. And, it even began to melt their hearts.
02 11 [rumbling]
02 11 [accent] The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land...
02 15 Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
02 15 Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
02 16 Yeah, just look at me! [kisses]
02 16 Yeah?
02 20 [sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage...
02 20 [hoofsteps]
02 20 Huh? Twilight...!
02 20 It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?
02 20 Three A.M.?
02 20 Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?
02 20 We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
02 20 And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
02 20 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
02 20 What is that thing?
02 20 Destroy Equestria?!
02 20 [yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
02 20 [door opening and closing]
02 20 Hey Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?
02 20 Hurrh... hu- [belches]
02 20 What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.
02 20 ...A paper cut...? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine.
02 20 [laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!
02 20 My lectures?
02 20 Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!
02 20 [ice cream splatting]
02 20 Mmm! [muffled] So good! [eating noisily]
02 20 [chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem.
02 20 [knocking]
02 20 She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it's gonna prevent the disaster from happening!
02 20 [laughing]
02 20 Wait, waitwait, let me try!
02 20 Whoaoa- [belches]
02 20 [whoomph]
02 20 I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!
02 20 You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!
02 20 It's Madame Pinkie's place.
02 20 Hey Pinkie.
02 20 Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike.
02 20 You've been awake too long, Twilight.
02 20 Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.
02 20 I dunno why we have to wear these things, either.
02 20 [sighs] Let's get this over with.
02 20 [splat]
02 20 Uh, Twilight?
02 20 Isn't this where we came in?
02 20 Oof!
02 20 But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!
02 20 Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning.
02 20 I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day.
02 20 I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?
02 20 [laughing]
02 20 Yeah, you do!
02 20 That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
02 20 [stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh...
02 21 Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
02 21 What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales. Feathers. That's one tough stain!
02 21 I don't act like other dragons?
02 21 What's that?
02 21 Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?
02 21 Rrrgh!
02 21 Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!
02 21 What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?
02 21 Seriously? That's all you know?
02 21 That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!
02 21 Really? You'd do that?
02 21 Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!
02 21 I wonder if dragons cry...
02 21 It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!
02 21 Waugh!
02 21 Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!
02 21 Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
02 21 And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them.
02 21 I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
02 21 Ngh! Hey! Give it back!
02 21 Whoa!
02 21 Really?
02 21 We know.
02 21 Thanks, everypony. I know it will.
02 21 Ugh!
02 21 Nngh...
02 21 [dragons roaring]
02 21 [gulps]
02 21 [distant shouting]
02 21 Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size.
02 21 Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike.
02 21 No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that...
02 21 Not exactly...
02 21 No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!
02 21 [dragons laughing]
02 21 Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and-
02 21 Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!
02 21 Nnh, I am a real dragon!
02 21 Well... how?
02 21 [gulps] [belches]
02 21 Uh...
02 21 Good old tail wrestling...
02 21 [sounds of exertion]
02 21 Yeah! Maybe I am!
02 21 Alright, who's next?
02 21 Whooooooooa!
02 21 But... I get an A for effort?
02 21 Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!
02 21 [dragons laughing]
02 21 This is my chance.
02 21 King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!
02 21 [gulps]
02 21 Nuh!
02 21 Guh!
02 21 [gulps] [screams]
02 21 [thwack]
02 21 Ugh... Was I... that bad?
02 21 Man, was that a great party.
02 21 I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever.
02 21 [sighs]
02 21 Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched.
02 21 Uh, sorry guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!
02 21 Heh... lucky me...
02 21 Hey Mr and Mrs Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually...
02 21 Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!
02 21 [phoenix caws]
02 21 [yelps]
02 21 [continues yelping]
02 21 [phoenix chicks screeching]
02 21 Huh, what have we got here? What happened?
02 21 Uh...
02 21 Smash the egg?
02 21 No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!
02 21 I said no.
02 21 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Garble</span>: No one says no to me. [growls]
02 21 Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons.
02 21 Run away!
02 21 [yelps]
02 21 Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys.
02 21 You're more than friends. You're my family.
02 21 Dear Princess Celestia, seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family. Yours truly, Spike.
02 21 [egg cracking]
02 21 [phoenix chick chirping]
02 21 Aww. [chuckles] Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony.
02 21 [credits]
02 22 Uh... intermission?
02 22 It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
02 22 .5? Isn't that like... less than one?
02 22 [tok]
02 22 Ow!
02 22 What did he say?
02 22 What's that?
02 22 [montage music resumes]
02 22 [anemometer squeaking]
02 22 Actually, it was only 2.3, and- ow!
02 22 [zipping noise]
02 22 It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!
02 22 Look!
02 22 But he's not the only one.
02 22 Well, should we pack up?
02 22 [takes deep breath, blows horn]
02 22 [wind howling]
02 22 [giant anemometer squeaking]
02 22 You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
02 22 [blows horn]
02 22 [wind howling]
02 22 [giant anemometer squeaking]
02 22 [yelps] They fell apart right after this!
02 22 It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
02 22 [blows horn]
02 23 [sighs] I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
02 23 Aaah!
02 23 Well, do it quietly, will ya? [sigh] Some of us are trying to unwind!
02 23 She did one on me.
02 23 Aaaah!
02 23 [yelps, and belches]
02 23 Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!
02 23 A-ha! [muffled] Twilight thought you might try show your faces around here, so she put up a force field.
02 25 Twi... light! ...I... have... lemme just... [deep breath] [belch]
02 25 Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
02 25 So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?
02 25 'Rainbow Dash>,  Rarity>,  Pinkie'> Pie, > Applejack, and > Fluttershy
02 25 [laughter]
02 25 [deep voice] I do. Do you? [high voice] I do! [kissing noises] [laughs nervously]
02 25 [high voice] Who, me?
02 25 [laughs nervously]
02 25 [kissing noises and laughing]
02 25 [deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do!
02 26 Oh yeah? Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party!
02 26 [laughing]
03 01 Twilight, calm down. It's just a test.
03 01 Uh...yes.
03 01 Ah! Twilight! That was fast! Let me guess, you got a perfect score?! A-minus? B-plus? [gasp] Twilight, did you... [quietly] fail?
03 01 She can't be sure...
03 01 Her heart is pure...
03 01 Oh no, she wasn't
03 01 Oh no, she wasn't
03 01 Prepared... for this!
03 01 Uh, prepared for what, exactly?
03 01 Well that was a total bust.
03 01 [grunting]
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
