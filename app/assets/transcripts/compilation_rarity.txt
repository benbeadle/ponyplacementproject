rarity No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.
rarity Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo-  Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!
rarity Out of my hair? What about your hair?!
rarity No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.
rarity Huh?
rarity 
rarity Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamor, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!
rarity Huh?
rarity [ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]
rarity She's gone!
rarity [ponies gasping]
rarity She's gone.
rarity Ugh, Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful.
rarity Take that, you ruffian!
rarity My hair! Woop--
rarity Eugh. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally.
rarity I didn't see you there, my apologies.
rarity She is.
rarity Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
rarity And your expertly coiffed mane.
rarity Your fabulous manicure.
rarity All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
rarity I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
rarity You look smashing.
rarity Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.
rarity Look!
rarity Oh, thank goodness.
rarity I know! I'll never part with it again.
rarity What? Ooh. So does yours.
rarity  Are these what I think they are?
rarity The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamor! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.
rarity Him. I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, "Who is that mysterious mare?" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say,"Yes!" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is  what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.
rarity Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph.
rarity You haven't?
rarity You? You want to go to the gala?
rarity But Twilight-
rarity Twilight, it's raining.
rarity Come with me before you catch a cold.
rarity Oh no, it's quite alright. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?
rarity Makeovers!
rarity There. Oh, you're simply darling.
rarity And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
rarity Now you just need a hat.
rarity  Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at The Grand Galloping Gala.
rarity  And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn. Ah, [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course.
rarity Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.
rarity Allow us to treat you to dinner.
rarity But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
rarity 
rarity Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
rarity Messy? Well, did you see her mane?
rarity Ooo. 
rarity I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.
rarity Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?
rarity My, my, my! What boasting!
rarity Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
rarity  Just who does she think she is?
rarity Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
rarity Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.
rarity A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
rarity Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
rarity Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair!  Such an awful, awful color! 
rarity Hate you?
rarity Why, whatever do you mean, darling?
rarity Most unpleasant.
rarity Mm-hmm.
rarity Huh?
rarity Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?
rarity Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
rarity 
rarity Ewww! Much better. Onward!
rarity Good thing I brought my scarf.
rarity I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!
rarity Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
rarity Almost there.
rarity Eugh. Bu-la-la-la-la.
rarity Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.
rarity 
rarity My apologies.
rarity  Obviously, this situation just calls for a little "pony charm". Allow me, girls. I'm so sorry to interrupt. [clears throat] But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?
rarity Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
rarity 
rarity I was this close to getting that diamond.
rarity Oh, yeah... sure.
rarity 
rarity Darling, you look ridiculous.
rarity Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
rarity Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.
rarity I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
rarity Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
rarity Oh! Ah! Oh Ph!! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
rarity  Oh, no, no, no!
rarity I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
rarity  Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
rarity  That doesn't even make any sense.
rarity Does not.
rarity Does not.
rarity Does not.
rarity Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
rarity On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
rarity Nor am I.
rarity After you!
rarity [thunder cracks]
rarity [>Applejack and >Rarity yelp]
rarity Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
rarity Oh! Unacceptable.
rarity Twilight?
rarity Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
rarity Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
rarity It may indeed be a problem.
rarity Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack.
rarity Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.
rarity Yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]
rarity Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
rarity  To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
rarity Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
rarity So do we have an agreement?
rarity Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
rarity Fortunately, I can get along with any pony, no matter how difficult she may be.
rarity <span class="anchor" style="display: none;" id="notaword">notaword</span>>Applejack
rarity Oh yeah? Well, I'm the get-alongin'ist pony yer ever gonna meet.
rarity That's not even a word.
rarity Yay.
rarity So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?
rarity Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated every pony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!
rarity It is a ghost story, they're all made up.
rarity 
rarity  
rarity Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered -- that's critical -- and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da! 
rarity  You could at least say excuse me.
rarity I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
rarity I think the truth of the matter is that some pony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
rarity !
rarity Fine! 
rarity Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a fru-fru, glittery, lacey outfit.
rarity Very. 
rarity I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
rarity And I dare you to comb yours just once.
rarity Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. Oh! It! Is! On! 
rarity  She started it.
rarity Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
rarity They were. There might still be a little on them.
rarity Eww!
rarity I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
rarity Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
rarity Hey!
rarity You did that on purpose.
rarity Get up so I can fix it again.
rarity M-mmm!
rarity You will if you want any blankets.
rarity I will not!
rarity Won't!
rarity Won't!
rarity Won't!
rarity No, it is I who have been trying my best.
rarity No, it was I.
rarity I!
rarity 
rarity But I--
rarity Wait! Stop! Don't!
rarity 
rarity  I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
rarity Cleaning up this mess some pony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you.
rarity What was that?
rarity Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky.
rarity Oh. Let's do this.
rarity 
rarity U-ugh. Oh, I look awful.
rarity Hmph, thanks.
rarity 
rarity Is it smaller than a saddle?
rarity Are we getting warmer?
rarity Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
rarity It is?
rarity 
rarity Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
rarity Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.
rarity Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
rarity Are too.
rarity Are too.
rarity Are too.
rarity 
rarity 
rarity 
rarity Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.
rarity  Sorry.
rarity 
rarity 
rarity 
rarity Just look at those stripes! So garish!
rarity 
rarity 
rarity Then, she lurks by the stores.
rarity She went outside!
rarity Wicked, wicked zebra!
rarity I'm afraid I have to agree. [Blows hair out of her face]
rarity [Spike and Twilight yell in surprise]
rarity Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
rarity And I as well.
rarity Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
rarity Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?
rarity Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!
rarity Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
rarity Oh. I look horrible!
rarity Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!
rarity [Ponies gasp]
rarity She stole your song?
rarity You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
rarity You made me look ridiculous.
rarity And the creepy decor?
rarity Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
rarity Ooh. I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
rarity Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
rarity Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
rarity [flattered laughter] Thank you Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
rarity Huh?
rarity Me too, oh, they're perfect.
rarity Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
rarity Oh! Are you okay? Aaah!  Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross. No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique.
rarity 
rarity Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
rarity Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
rarity  I see we're having the same problem.
rarity Ew! If you ask me it's already a total disaster.
rarity 
rarity Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
rarity My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! 
rarity 
rarity And even though I love my boots
rarity This fashion's getting old
rarity Little critters hibernate
rarity Under the snow and ice
rarity We help them gather up their food
rarity Fix their homes below
rarity So their families can grow!
rarity Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
rarity Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
rarity Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
rarity Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.
rarity Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...
rarity Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this, 
rarity Ah, and we need to weave the string...
rarity 
rarity Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping up in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
rarity Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.
rarity Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.
rarity What's that? You want to help me more! Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
rarity Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.
rarity [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity Is there something I can help you with?
rarity Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!
rarity Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
rarity Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
rarity Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.
rarity You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.
rarity What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
rarity Deal!
rarity Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.
rarity I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
rarity Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!
rarity Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
rarity Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
rarity [>Rarity]
rarity Thread by thread, stitching it together

rarity It's Applejack's new dress
rarity Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink

rarity Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
rarity Yard by yard, never stressed
rarity And that's the art of the dress!
rarity That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now! These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out BEAUTIFUL, don't you think? Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?
rarity But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
rarity That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them.
rarity I want them to be better that just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
rarity Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.
rarity What have I gotten myself into?
rarity Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?
rarity Oh, you're just saying that.
rarity "Nice"?
rarity If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
rarity Like it or love it?
rarity Which is it?
rarity Well, just tell me what you really think.
rarity Tell me.
rarity Tell me!
rarity Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!
rarity Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
rarity Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
rarity Even if my fabric choice was perfect
rarity Gotta get them all done by tonight
rarity Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive
rarity Wait until you see it in the light
rarity I'm sewing them together!
rarity Well, I think...
rarity Well...
rarity Hour by hour, one more change
rarity I'm sewing them together, take great pains
rarity Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
rarity Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
rarity Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
rarity Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine

rarity Brings a whole new revision
rarity Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision
rarity Ugh...
rarity Streamers?
rarity Streamers it is.
rarity Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
rarity Do you not like the color?
rarity Do you not like the shape?
rarity Got to overcome intimidation
rarity Remember, it's all in the presentation!
rarity Piece by piece, snip by snip
rarity Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
rarity Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
rarity Yard by yard, always stressed
rarity And that's the art of the dress!
rarity Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
rarity Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
rarity Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.
rarity Hoity-Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?
rarity Oh.  There he is! [deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. UUUAAA, what's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.
rarity I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock! 
rarity Leave me alone! I want to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'M SO PATHETIC!
rarity Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?
rarity Huh? Opal?
rarity Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!
rarity Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
rarity What is it? It's not... You... 
rarity Like it? Like it?!
rarity No, I don't like it.
rarity I LOVE IT!
rarity You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
rarity Oh, I forgive you.
rarity But my whole career is still ruined!
rarity Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!
rarity 
rarity Go on, go on.
rarity Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
rarity Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!
rarity You've got to try!
rarity I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
rarity I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
rarity Yes!
rarity [in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!
rarity Oh, wait for me!
rarity Why, thank you!
rarity Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
rarity  Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.
rarity [snowflake workers grumbling and yelling]
rarity Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that.
rarity Oh, they were just admiring my wings Rainbow Dash.
rarity Why, these old things? Go ahead everypony. Photos are encouraged.
rarity Oh pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?
rarity Waa-haa-haa!
rarity There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
rarity I'm going to be awhile!
rarity I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
rarity Rarity... Is ready!
rarity Well Rainbow Dash? Shall we?
rarity Good luck Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.
rarity And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] They'll be talking about it for years!
rarity  Look upon me Equestria, for I Am Rarity!
rarity [crowd oohs]
rarity Uh-oh. 
rarity [Screams some more]
rarity [more screaming]
rarity 
rarity  You sure did. Oh thank you Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!
rarity I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
rarity And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
rarity Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
rarity I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
rarity Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already...  Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to-- oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?
rarity No!
rarity No thanks!
rarity Just stand over there.
rarity Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!
rarity 
rarity [clattering noises]
rarity Aah!
rarity [crashing noises]
rarity 
rarity [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity No. You've helped me quite enough.
rarity I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
rarity Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
rarity [doorbell rings]
rarity Oh, what now?!
rarity  Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
rarity Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
rarity Ahh! Did you use... The Stare on her?
rarity Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
rarity I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
rarity No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.
rarity 
rarity See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
rarity Well, I, uh...
rarity I'll manage.
rarity Hello, uh, girls ...
rarity Sweetie Belle! What have you DONE? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
rarity I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
rarity No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle; it's just the way it has to be.
rarity I couldn't ask you to do that.
rarity Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
rarity I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
rarity I assure you, they're quite a handful.
rarity Well... all right.
rarity Hmmm...
rarity [clattering hooves]
rarity  Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again.
rarity I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
rarity Girls! Time to-- Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to-- GIRLS!
rarity Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?
rarity Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.
rarity How about now? 
rarity [Opal yowls]
rarity Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
rarity Perfect!
rarity [doorbell ringing]
rarity Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique and magnifique.  Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop!
rarity You yah... Y-y-you know my name?
rarity Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?
rarity  How may I help you, Sapphire?
rarity I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pièce de résistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.
rarity Really?
rarity Beg pardon?
rarity 
rarity Spike, a lady is never jealous.
rarity Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. O, aha!
rarity Yes, Spike! Right there!
rarity Spike! I promised I'll give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
rarity Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.
rarity Spike!
rarity You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you'll get the finest reward. This is from me to you.
rarity Is something wrong, Spike?
rarity Oh, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.
rarity Spike! Where are you?
rarity You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
rarity I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak.
rarity Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo... Ewww! Uh... uh... Good day, gentle... uh, fellow. I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
rarity And you are...
rarity Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I know diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um,  are you out hunting for gems as well?
rarity Uh... we?
rarity Spike! Come on! Hurry!
rarity Waah! Spike!
rarity Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you scum! You rough-!
rarity Spike! Ah, dirt! Aaaaah, Aaaaah!
rarity Save me...!
rarity Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!
rarity Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.
rarity But what ever do you want from me?
rarity Oh! Is that all?
rarity There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?
rarity What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
rarity Dig?
rarity Ohh...
rarity Forgive me but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.
rarity I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
rarity Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with that jagged things.
rarity Good heavens, what is that smell?
rarity Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.
rarity Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated. You look and smell like if you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Water, water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?
rarity And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity".
rarity Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!
rarity But I thought you wanted whiiining!
rarity  Anything?
rarity Oh, this water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.
rarity What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh!  Not sooo tiiight!
rarity Did you just call me a... mule?
rarity Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly? 
rarity He called me ugly!
rarity An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
rarity You're just saying that!
rarity I don't believe you! You never liked me! 
rarity Why, yes. Hello, girls. You are just in time to assist me.
rarity With those.
rarity Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
rarity Me? What did I teach you?
rarity Not if you eat them all, Spike.
rarity 
rarity 
rarity So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. [to the spa ponies] The usual!
rarity But you will not believe what happened to me.
rarity Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street? But Photo Finish!
rarity She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anyhow, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
rarity She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
rarity Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
rarity But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you!
rarity Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me.
rarity Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
rarity Nopony!
rarity Please!
rarity Please!
rarity Please, please, PLEEEASE!
rarity Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
rarity Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution!
rarity [cut to the spa]
rarity The usual!
rarity [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
rarity More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress need more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins! And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon. Oh, this hem is completely off. PINCUSHION! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous.
rarity Let me just say, what an honor!
rarity Attitude and pizzazz!
rarity Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.
rarity Really?
rarity Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria".
rarity Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.
rarity No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!
rarity Never.
rarity That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.
rarity But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?
rarity Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! YOU MUST!
rarity It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.
rarity I just vant to be alone right now.
rarity Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
rarity Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing" at the place.
rarity I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
rarity [door bell]
rarity Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
rarity Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs.
rarity Rarity, of course.
rarity My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
rarity Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
rarity I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!
rarity Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.
rarity Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
rarity [hilarity in the process of ensuing]
rarity Oh no.
rarity Bravo! I say bravo!
rarity Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
rarity Fluttershy! Are you all right?
rarity Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.
rarity I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
rarity You do?
rarity Then why did you keep doing it?
rarity And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
rarity All this time!
rarity I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
rarity Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
rarity We go!
rarity Isn't it, though?
rarity Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
rarity No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
rarity Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
rarity It's widdle Rarity who's all 'saddy-waddy'! Urgh!
rarity [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity [indistinct conversations: >Rainbow Dash
rarity Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting I can't even wait!
rarity  For crying out loud in the morning!
rarity [more indistinct conversations: >Fluttershy(?)
rarity I can't wait! >Rainbow Dash
rarity Yeah, yeah!]
rarity Would you all be QUIET... NOOOOW!!!???
rarity I just love their accessories!
rarity I want to speak to the manager!
rarity They took Spike!
rarity Ow!  Gently, please!
rarity About the trees. Now if you could –
rarity Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!
rarity Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!
rarity Put me down!
rarity Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
rarity Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.[Rarity's flashback begins where there is a practice for a school play going on, a group of fillies, a younger version of Cheerilee, the future teacher of Apple Bloom's class, are in costumes for the play: a group of fruit, a dandellion, a cake, a stack of hay, and a flower. The camera pans from group to the filly version of Rarity, and her teacher, who are watching the play practice from behind the scenes.]
rarity I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night.
rarity I had no idea where my horn was taking me.
rarity But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason.
rarity I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark!
rarity I knew that this was... MY DESTINY!
rarity Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
rarity There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
rarity We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
rarity Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
rarity Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
rarity Ooh, poor little thing.
rarity And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
rarity [Spike rages]
rarity Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
rarity This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your “Spring Has Sprung” party?
rarity Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirée.
rarity   Hmm… perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that’s been wrapped in moldy hay, and dipped in dragon perspiration.
rarity Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What’s the occasion?
rarity The party is this afternoon? As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
rarity Oh… do they?
rarity And I’m sure that we would, but I’m going to have to decline. I have to… wash my hair!
rarity It doesn’t?
rarity See?  Dirty! I have to go!
rarity She didn’t see you at the sweet shop, did she?
rarity Oh, good. I’d hate for her to ruin everything.
rarity Have you seen her?
rarity Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
rarity Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
rarity  See you later!
rarity We’ve been planning this party for such a long time. We had to make excuses for why we couldn’t attend Gummy’s party, so that we could get everything ready for yours.
rarity That’s what we’ve been trying to tell you, darling.
rarity Aww, he was upset?
rarity Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
rarity Where are the others? It's getting late.
rarity What ever shall we do?
rarity Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?
rarity Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
rarity  I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
rarity We'll just have to see.
rarity At the Gala, all the royals
rarity They will meet fair Rarity
rarity They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala! (at the Gala)
rarity I will find him, my Prince Charming,
rarity And how gallant he will be,
rarity He will treat me like a lady, tonight at the Gala!
rarity [>Choir]
rarity This is what we've waited for, to have the best night ever!
rarity Each of us will live our dreams, tonight at the Gala, at the Gala!
rarity Find my prince
rarity To find!
rarity  [sounds of excitement] Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... WAIT! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined.
rarity I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
rarity 
rarity This isn't at all what I imagined.
rarity I waited all my life...
rarity Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
rarity Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
rarity Yes. "One" certainly would.
rarity Oh, of course it will.
rarity Two apple fritters, please.
rarity Ahem.
rarity Ahem!
rarity  I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
rarity Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.
rarity 
rarity [angry growl] You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
rarity Afraid to get dirty?!
rarity  No! Ugh! Let's go!
rarity ...being together here has made it all better.
rarity Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella.
rarity Spike, Twilight will come up with something.
rarity Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
rarity I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
rarity Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
rarity See you in the center.
rarity I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sports. Agh. Oh my...
rarity Yes, I like very much. No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others.  Mine! Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home. 
rarity [wall crash]
rarity What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! 
rarity Little help here! Thanks, Twilight.
rarity But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
rarity [thunder crash]
rarity HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!
rarity Don't touch my gem!
rarity 
rarity Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!
rarity Well, it's not going to work.
rarity Mm-mm.
rarity Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish.
rarity Mine!
rarity No, but if you want it, I want it!
rarity 
rarity MINE!
rarity  What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--!
rarity Let us never speak of this again.
rarity How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of cloud is Cloudsdale?
rarity I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
rarity WHOA!
rarity PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
rarity Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?
rarity [loud scream]
rarity [more loud screaming]
rarity  Why me-e-e-e-e-ee... WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
rarity  I've lost my diamond encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched HIGH, and I have searched LOW. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!
rarity Oh there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?
rarity Mmhm!
rarity Yeah.
rarity Hmm... there is one thing.
rarity I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
rarity Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight?
rarity Please tell me I did not forget the plates.  I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!  Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
rarity [various shock statements]
rarity Yes?
rarity Yes?
rarity Yes?
rarity [sighs of relief]
rarity 
rarity Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking...
rarity Don't look at what?
rarity Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!
rarity As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
rarity Mmhmm.
rarity [All right, etc]
rarity 
rarity And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
rarity 
rarity [fades in] [mumbling in sleep] Oh... Are those sweet... carrot... pancakes I smell?  Mmm, how divine, num num num num. The aroma... spiced warm apple cider.  Ahh, and, the smell of... smoke... smoke? Smoke?! 
rarity 
rarity [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity 
rarity Father! Mother!
rarity I... figured.  I didn't know you could burn juice.
rarity Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant this week'?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?
rarity So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?
rarity But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
rarity 
rarity Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
rarity Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
rarity Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going.
rarity Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.
rarity You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
rarity Okay, now easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here...
rarity Not... bad.
rarity  There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
rarity Sweetie Belle!
rarity Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
rarity The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool- shrinks...
rarity Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create.
rarity Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?
rarity [in Sweetie Belle's mind] Stay out of trouble, okay?
rarity  Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
rarity But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
rarity  Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?
rarity That's not what I meant!
rarity Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
rarity No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
rarity Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle? [gasps in shock]
rarity My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
rarity This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you- and you put everything away!
rarity But this was my mess, in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
rarity Happy?! Happy?! I- I just need some time alone. Hm!
rarity What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.
rarity Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister.
rarity Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
rarity  Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
rarity Deal!
rarity Hmph!
rarity Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [breathes in] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't- [clears throat] No matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!
rarity Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favourite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle-
rarity Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm.
rarity Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project? Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!  Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!
rarity  Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I-
rarity Oh Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.
rarity Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear-
rarity What?!
rarity But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I, I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favourite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?
rarity Uh... yes?
rarity Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
rarity Of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
rarity But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!
rarity That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line.
rarity Mm-hmm.
rarity Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
rarity Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!
rarity The spa, of course.
rarity No, I, I, I'm serious.
rarity Very well then, what shall we write to the Princess?
rarity I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
rarity A little bit dirty.
rarity A little bit dirty!
rarity Deal!
rarity [birds chirping]
rarity 
rarity A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
rarity Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
rarity Say you're sorry, Opal.
rarity She's... sorry.
rarity Tortoise!
rarity I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it! 
rarity Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
rarity I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
rarity  Here? I get to stay here?
rarity Thank you so much, Princess.
rarity No, really. This is so nice of you.
rarity Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! [more kisses]
rarity Thank you!
rarity Thank you!
rarity That's perfect.

rarity Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot?  Ahh. Everything! I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.  Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence?
rarity Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I-
rarity Oh, yes, of course... how are you?
rarity Well, yeah, yes, but-
rarity [disappointed sigh]
rarity ”Looked a little country”. ”Not something you can get in Canterlot”. I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!
rarity  I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party.  Fancypants?
rarity Oh goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there, I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and--
rarity Wh- The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
rarity Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days.  Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.
rarity Me?
rarity Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.
rarity Rarity.
rarity Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro: Fancypants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancypants! [excited giggling]
rarity Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
rarity I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
rarity [ponies gasp]
rarity 
rarity 
rarity 
rarity My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
rarity Uh...  Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
rarity ...and then I said, “Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"
rarity [ponies laughing]
rarity Oh, I'd love to, but I-
rarity Well, that sounds wonderful, but I-
rarity I'm flattered, really, it's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-
rarity ...of course I'll be there.
rarity [the three ponies uttering relief]
rarity Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancypants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?
rarity I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go
rarity I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow
rarity I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity Becoming as popular as popular can be
rarity Making my mark, making my mark in high society
rarity I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah
rarity I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity See how they hang on every word that I speak
rarity My approving glance is what they all seek
rarity I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe
rarity I'm the type of pony everypony should know

rarity Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot
rarity I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe, yeah

rarity Because I'm the type of pony
rarity Yes, I'm the type of pony
rarity Yes, I'm the type of pony everypony should know
rarity Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
rarity We'd better get going.
rarity I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensem-

rarity For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon... Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust!  The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot!  Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony.  It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.
rarity No. But, I will need some help unpacking them.
rarity What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!
rarity 
rarity What are you-- how did you-- Why are you--
rarity What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
rarity Wow... first you get me a suite at Canterlot castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight.
rarity This? Uh- well I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up. [laughs nervously]
rarity Oh, uhh, she's... hold on a minute.
rarity [doors slam]
rarity I am so sorry about this.
rarity [running water]
rarity She's resting on the bed.
rarity Yes.
rarity [sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
rarity Fancypants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Haha.
rarity Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance... I'm here!
rarity I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
rarity ...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
rarity  Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me...
rarity 
rarity I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
rarity I really should go check on Opal...
rarity Is that Princess Celestia?
rarity  I need to use the little fillies' room!
rarity Can I get anypony more punch?
rarity I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...? [trails off]
rarity  What croquet mallet?
rarity [laughs nervously] Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...
rarity I, I...
rarity Twilight let me explain! I-
rarity You must understand! I-
rarity Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason. [laughs nervously]
rarity Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.
rarity Nothing. See you girls later!
rarity Oh no!
rarity 
rarity [many birds chirping]
rarity 
rarity [nervous laugh] Yeah.
rarity [spit-take]
rarity Fancypants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing, that's over there. On the other side of the room.
rarity That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old-
rarity Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.
rarity With pleasure!
rarity Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.
rarity I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
rarity  Hellooo?  Anypony home? Twilight?  Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets...
rarity Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?
rarity Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game...  I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
rarity Like it? It's magnificent.
rarity I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!  Thank you so much!
rarity Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!
rarity I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm.
rarity  Perhaps some more ruffle. 
rarity 
rarity [ponies screaming]
rarity 
rarity Put me down, you brute!
rarity How rude.
rarity Hey! I'm- Not some- -sort of common- fly swatter!
rarity Girls! My cape!
rarity 
rarity Oh be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
rarity Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?
rarity 
rarity Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.
rarity Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey! 
rarity Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!
rarity Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
rarity Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve, in their own towns. It's tradition.
rarity Well no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
rarity Hundreds.
rarity  Maybe even thousands!
rarity Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
rarity My hair!
rarity 
rarity  How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!
rarity Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!
rarity I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!
rarity 
rarity  Clover the Clever! I need you!
rarity Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble, and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!
rarity We must find a new land!
rarity Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?
rarity Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?
rarity Stoooooop!
rarity That is what's wrong!
rarity [water rushing]
rarity I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.
rarity And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library.
rarity I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled!  In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!
rarity We found our new home!
rarity Did not!
rarity All of you riff-raff are trespassing in Unicornia!
rarity Unicornia!
rarity That's barbaric. Clover the Clever? Throw that brute into the dungeon!
rarity 
rarity 
rarity Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
rarity Please, Commander Hothead.
rarity [clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
rarity Indeed not! You see this invisible line?
rarity Clover the Clever?
rarity That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows, there could be jewels inside.
rarity Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!
rarity Give me my rock!
rarity [arguing over rock]
rarity You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
rarity How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
rarity Pegasi are brutes!
rarity Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.
rarity I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
rarity Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
rarity Moi? Babysit? N- oh nonononononononono. - I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
rarity Oh, something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
rarity Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!
rarity Yes, why are you here?
rarity And you are...?
rarity Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.
rarity And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
rarity Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
rarity Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
rarity That was rude!
rarity What? Pinkie- 
rarity 
rarity 
rarity [railway crossing bells]
rarity When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
rarity This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
rarity Of course.
rarity Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...
rarity She's dazzling!
rarity 
rarity Ohh.
rarity And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
rarity Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
rarity How's our patient doing today?
rarity Oh, well don't mind us Rainbow Dash.
rarity Uh, on second thought-
rarity Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
rarity Pardon?
rarity Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
rarity You've got to stop being such a doormat.
rarity A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
rarity Watch and learn. Hold it right there, mister small and handsome.
rarity Oh, of course, you. Nopony ever called you handsome before?
rarity Oh, well they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me?  Oh my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
rarity [bit clinking]
rarity See, that's not so hard, is it?
rarity Alright then! What else is on your list?
rarity 
rarity So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
rarity It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
rarity Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
rarity Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
rarity Old Rarity agrees.
rarity Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!
rarity No sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
rarity What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.
rarity Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!
rarity 
rarity [starts crying] I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
rarity 
rarity [knocks, clears throat] Fluttershy, are you in there?
rarity Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
rarity Shh.
rarity  Sweetie,  Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.
rarity Yes!  You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
rarity Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
rarity What a darling little catchphrase.
rarity  I'm sure a big, brave, powerful and rich monster- I mean, minotaur, like you, doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later.
rarity Do something!
rarity [wood crunching]
rarity In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!
rarity Friends.
rarity 
rarity What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
rarity Yoo-hoo! Well?
rarity [party horns]
rarity What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
rarity Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
rarity  And 'formidable'.
rarity You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
rarity My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
rarity Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
rarity The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
rarity Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red, it is most becoming.
rarity Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
rarity Hey guys!
rarity Good morning!
rarity An early start?
rarity What?!?
rarity Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutsey-wutsey head!
rarity Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!
rarity I suppose not.
rarity We know.
rarity Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!
rarity [through her grin] We're following him, right?
rarity Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous: one of my finer creations.
rarity We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
rarity Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow.
rarity Forever?!
rarity Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
rarity 
rarity And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
rarity Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
rarity [dragons laughing]
rarity 
rarity 
rarity Ohh, Sweetie Belle... was she raised in a barn or something?  Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity... Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity. Hello... what's this?  Gum on their bum!  Too rich!
rarity Bleh! I, I was just-
rarity Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!
rarity It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
rarity Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new-
rarity Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!
rarity We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
rarity Oh, lighten up, Twilight, there's nothing but harmless gossip!
rarity 
rarity Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
rarity Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this.
rarity Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they dese-  I'll >destroy her! “The Drama-Queen Diaries”... she's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!
rarity  My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely-
rarity -most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
rarity Et tu, Gabby Gums?!
rarity The gilded pages of your betrayal!
rarity How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?
rarity What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
rarity Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
rarity I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
rarity MMMM?
rarity Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
rarity  What? Is it a crime to change one's style every now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.
rarity Fine, I'm guilty!  I wear false eyelashes. Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
rarity You just made it sound so delectable.
rarity I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
rarity Terribly sorry.
rarity Ahh!
rarity [running footsteps]
rarity It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
rarity [running footsteps]
rarity Princess Celestia wants me to-  ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!
rarity 
rarity  So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a Captain of the Royal Guard?
rarity Ooh, ooh, oooh!
rarity 
rarity I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
rarity Now let's get going, we've got work to do!
rarity Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]
rarity  Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!
rarity Oh, yes, of course.
rarity Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!
rarity Well of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
rarity The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
rarity 
rarity Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
rarity Told you she was an absolute gem!
rarity Ehm - I'll see what I can do.
rarity AND MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
rarity They flew a flag of many hues
rarity Oh, we have to get this right
rarity Yes we have to make them see
rarity We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
rarity Oh, we have to get this right
rarity Yes we have to make them see
rarity We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
rarity It is so on!
