applejack Yeehaw!
applejack 
applejack Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like making new friends!
applejack So, what can I do you for?
applejack We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
applejack Soup's on, everypony!
applejack 
applejack Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
applejack This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.
applejack Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
applejack Are you all right, sugarcube?
applejack [train whistle blowing]
applejack  Whoa there, Nelly...
applejack Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?
applejack No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
applejack And it ain't natural. Folk say it don't work the same as Equestria.
applejack Rainbow, quit it.
applejack Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
applejack Let go.
applejack No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
applejack Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
applejack YEE-HAW! Get along, little doggie.
applejack Whoa! All yours, partner.
applejack Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
applejack It's just mud. Ahh!
applejack 
applejack 
applejack That's what all the fuss is about?
applejack Twilight, wait for us.
applejack Whoa. Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
applejack What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
applejack Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
applejack Twilight, where are you?
applejack Come on!
applejack Everypony okay?
applejack Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
applejack Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of granny's girdles. 
applejack  The Grand Galloping Gala!
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack The Grand Galloping Gala! 
applejack Woo-hoo!
applejack Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles till the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip. Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
applejack Rainbow Dash, you told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing, spyin'?
applejack Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.  I asked for that ticket first.
applejack Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket. 
applejack Drummin' up business for the farm?
applejack Money t' fix granny's hip.
applejack Okay.
applejack 
applejack Wait just another minute.
applejack No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
applejack Did somepony say lunch?
applejack I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?
applejack Is that a yes?
applejack So, that's a maybe?
applejack Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.
applejack We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
applejack Twilight, you don't have to do that.
applejack Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
applejack Whoa Nelly!
applejack 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop a' apples I ever laid eyes on.
applejack Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
applejack Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
applejack Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
applejack Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddle the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself. 
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
applejack YEEHAW!
applejack [ponies cheer]
applejack Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!
applejack Come on, little doggies! Turn!  Winona, put 'em up! Ha hah! Gotcha. 
applejack Attagirl.  Yee haw!
applejack [ponies cheer]
applejack Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
applejack I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
applejack Yee haw!
applejack I'm here. I'm here.   Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy.  It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo.
applejack Ooo-ooo.
applejack  Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and  and stuff.  Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.
applejack [sounds of dragging metal]
applejack   Phew.  O-oah.
applejack Whoops.
applejack 
applejack 
applejack Oh, howdy Twilight.
applejack It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
applejack Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
applejack 'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
applejack  They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?
applejack Could you step aside, Twilight?
applejack Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
applejack Help? No way, no how.
applejack Is that a challenge?
applejack Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.
applejack  I'm a might' sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
applejack Uh... Yeah.
applejack Isn't that a might' dangerous?
applejack Well, alrighty then. Oh my.
applejack 
applejack Got it.   
applejack You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this.  Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.
applejack Heh heh... Here I go!
applejack You're welcome!
applejack Ow!
applejack Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
applejack Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
applejack You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?
applejack Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
applejack That's quite neighborly of her.
applejack Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
applejack What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
applejack Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
applejack WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
applejack Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
applejack Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
applejack Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
applejack A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
applejack Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
applejack If you say so.
applejack Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
applejack   What? Huh?  
applejack Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight.  I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
applejack Hardy har.  And no I don't.
applejack Help? No thanks.  A little more...  Little...  There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on  apples  fall off .
applejack I knew that.
applejack You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
applejack Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
applejack Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
applejack Fine. Can we just get on with it?
applejack I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
applejack That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!
applejack We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.
applejack Must  keep  buckin'... just  a few  more. Must finish harvestin'.
applejack  Ha! No I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?
applejack  Where'd all the apple...?  
applejack Huh?
applejack Okay, Twilight.
applejack Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.
applejack How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!  Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.
applejack Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
applejack  Land sakes!
applejack 
applejack [squeaky toy]
applejack Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
applejack Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
applejack Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play.
applejack Nothin' at all, 'cept in when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.
applejack That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
applejack Can your magical powers do this?
applejack [banjo music]
applejack Top that, missy.
applejack Whoa! Uh!
applejack A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
applejack It's gorgeous.
applejack Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!
applejack All hat and no cattle.
applejack Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
applejack Mm-hmm.
applejack What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
applejack Huh?
applejack 
applejack Yaaa!
applejack [pop whistles]
applejack Let's go!
applejack Looks pretty cold up there.
applejack Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers an all.
applejack I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
applejack Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split.
applejack  We. Made. It. 
applejack You could just leap on over.
applejack That's it.
applejack Everypony okay?
applejack Aw, no big whoop, sugar cube.
applejack Wha! Wha...
applejack What's that, sugarcube?
applejack All of us are scared of that dragon.
applejack Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
applejack Now what?
applejack What in tarnation...?
applejack Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
applejack 
applejack  Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
applejack Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
applejack  Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.
applejack [rain pouring down]
applejack Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
applejack Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.
applejack What now?
applejack Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so.
applejack Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
applejack Does so.
applejack Does so.
applejack Does so.
applejack Does so infinity. Hah.
applejack I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
applejack I'm not sayin' anythin'.
applejack Y'all just be on yer way, then.
applejack Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast.
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta.
applejack Twilight?
applejack Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
applejack Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
applejack  If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.
applejack  What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?
applejack Slumber 101: Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night.  Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.
applejack Blahch. What in the world is this for?
applejack Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'!
applejack Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
applejack You betcha. 
applejack You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
applejack Yay.
applejack Just fine, Rarity.
applejack Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
applejack That's not a real story. You made it up.
applejack  
applejack Nah, ya just eat 'em.  Mmm-mmm! 
applejack Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon.
applejack Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.
applejack And I think the truth is some pony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
applejack I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
applejack Hah!
applejack  
applejack  Happy?
applejack I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
applejack I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
applejack I will if she will.
applejack My hooves ain't muddy.
applejack There ain't. See?
applejack Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
applejack Hey!
applejack Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!
applejack Ah.
applejack Um, yeah?
applejack Can't hear ya, I'm asleep. 
applejack I ain't budgin'.
applejack Give it back!
applejack Yes, you will!
applejack : Will!
applejack : Will!
applejack : Will!
applejack I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
applejack No, it was me.
applejack Me!
applejack 
applejack Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
applejack Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'.
applejack No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
applejack Well, ya should'a tried harder.  I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.
applejack What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
applejack We gotta do somethin'!
applejack  Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, alright?
applejack I said I'm sorry! I should'a listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!
applejack Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help.
applejack 
applejack Better?
applejack 
applejack Is it bigger than a barn?
applejack  We're never gonna guess what y'er thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.
applejack She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
applejack Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
applejack It is?
applejack 
applejack If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
applejack Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
applejack That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.
applejack Ugh. Are not.
applejack Are not!
applejack Are not.
applejack 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack Whu, which is it?  Whoa! That mess is your fault, not mine. 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack We're hidin' from her!
applejack [All gasp]
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
applejack No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
applejack So I swept her up and brought her here.
applejack For safe keepin'.
applejack Not from that creepy Zecora.
applejack Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept.... her!
applejack That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!
applejack [Crash that sounds like a thunderclap]
applejack The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
applejack All on their own!
applejack Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
applejack Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
applejack  That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!
applejack Apple Bloom?
applejack You get back here right now!
applejack Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
applejack [Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity speak over each other against Zecora]
applejack And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
applejack Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
applejack Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.
applejack [dream sequence]
applejack Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.
applejack [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
applejack [Spike and Twilight gasp]
applejack It's a curse, I tells ya!
applejack Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!
applejack I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
applejack Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
applejack Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!
applejack No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
applejack Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'M GONNA TELL Big McIntosh ON YOU! Aw pony feathers.
applejack Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddyup pony!
applejack YEEE-HAW!
applejack No, Rainbow Dash. Other way.
applejack I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!
applejack Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.
applejack 
applejack  Apple Bloom! You're okay!
applejack What in the hay does that mean?
applejack ... Will somepony please talk normal?
applejack LITTLE JOKES?! Very funny.
applejack I'm right here little sis. I ain't tiny no more!
applejack Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. HEY!
applejack  I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
applejack Yeeeeeee-haw!
applejack Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash. Hold on girls, we're almost there.
applejack Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
applejack Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
applejack Looks like our problems are solved.
applejack Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
applejack  My apples!
applejack No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
applejack Brace yourself y'all, here they come.  Didn't see that one comin'.
applejack So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
applejack But the food we've stored is runnin' out
applejack And we can't grow in this cold
applejack 'Cause tomorrow spring–
applejack No easy task to clear the ground
applejack Plant our tiny seeds
applejack With proper care and sunshine
applejack Everyone it feeds
applejack Apples, carrots, celery stalks
applejack Colorful flowers too
applejack We must work so very hard
applejack It's just so much to do!
applejack Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it Bumpkin, I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
applejack Oh, just dandy. Little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear ya hear. We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow high-tailed outta here.
applejack Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
applejack Well, I never turn down a hard worker but...
applejack Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
applejack And what in tarnation does that mean?
applejack What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?
applejack Nuts Twilight, you used magic.
applejack That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MAH farm.
applejack Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
applejack I'm tellin' you Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
applejack Go.
applejack Go.
applejack GO!
applejack And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
applejack Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
applejack Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
applejack 
applejack Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Every pony gets one eventually.
applejack 'course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I know my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.  Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh.
applejack Get your delicious nutritious apples here!
applejack Heh... she's so creative, heh.
applejack You forgot your change!
applejack I'm sorry ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just...
applejack Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. ...and these. ...and these.
applejack Y'all come back now, y'hear?
applejack Sorry little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
applejack Home. Now.
applejack Ugh. Listen sugar-cube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
applejack Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
applejack Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
applejack Yeah. I'm sure.
applejack [knock on the door]
applejack Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
applejack And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
applejack [ponies chatter]
applejack Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
applejack I know I can.  Oh, for Pete's sake!
applejack All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl.
applejack Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw.
applejack  Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.
applejack Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.
applejack Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better, heh heh heh.
applejack Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gilding the lily.
applejack Prove what?
applejack You know what, Rainbow? You're on.
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack An Iron--
applejack See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is--
applejack To be our judge and keep score.
applejack  Dagnabbit.
applejack You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
applejack  Nuts and chews! Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there.
applejack Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!
applejack What was the time on that, Spike?
applejack 18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?
applejack Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.
applejack [bell rings]
applejack [ponies cheer]
applejack Mighty respectable,  but let me show ya how it's really done.  [bell rings]
applejack [ponies cheer]
applejack Years of applebuckin'.
applejack [bell rings]
applejack 
applejack [ponies cheer]
applejack [bell rings]
applejack  Wuh
applejack [bell rings]
applejack Be a good sport, Applejack.
applejack 
applejack 
applejack  That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win.
applejack  You're cheatin'!
applejack I said... uh-oh. 
applejack [crowd cheers]
applejack [bell rings]
applejack Only 'cause you cheated.
applejack You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
applejack Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
applejack I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
applejack Hah! Prove it.
applejack Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
applejack Hold on! There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
applejack 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack The Iron phony, you mean.
applejack I'm ready to run a good, clean race.
applejack You are not allowed to use your wings.
applejack  Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
applejack 'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
applejack 
applejack Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
applejack  But have you ever run a race?
applejack Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck. 
applejack Not so easy without wings, is it?
applejack Whoa! I don't believe it.
applejack Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
applejack She did too!
applejack What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.
applejack See you at the finish line!
applejack It is for you. Heh.
applejack Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!
applejack  Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on.
applejack Later!
applejack Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?
applejack No, I said no wings.
applejack Whoa!
applejack You do?
applejack 
applejack Cut it out!
applejack You started it.
applejack Oh no, you won't.
applejack Oh no, you don't.
applejack No, I won!
applejack Tied?!
applejack For first?
applejack LAST?
applejack YOU?
applejack What? How's that even possible?
applejack You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.
applejack Princess Celestia?!
applejack W... What are you doin' here?
applejack I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport, Princess.
applejack Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?
applejack Howdy, Rarity!
applejack What do you think she's makin'?
applejack Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
applejack Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
applejack Hm... Nah.
applejack Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
applejack So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?
applejack They sure are... sumth'n.
applejack And we're plum grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
applejack Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
applejack What if it rains? Galoshes!
applejack Even if you simply have to fudge it
applejack Why, they're the best duds I ever did see.
applejack Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!
applejack Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
applejack Nah.  Okay, maybe a little.
applejack Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
applejack Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
applejack Well, that's mighty big of you.
applejack Oh, right. That.
applejack Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?
applejack  Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Woah! Nyu-uh!
applejack I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.
applejack Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?
applejack Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?
applejack  That's where Fluttershy's headed!
applejack We better go and make sure she's okay.
applejack I hope nothin'.
applejack I'm tryin' not to think about it.
applejack Just exploded? For no reason?
applejack Of course not.
applejack I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!
applejack [dragonfly buzzing]
applejack Fluttershy?
applejack Phew, what a relief.
applejack Um... Twilight?
applejack Who cares? RUN!
applejack [ponies screaming]
applejack 
applejack What are you talking about Pink?
applejack 
applejack Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
applejack And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
applejack Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder then the brass section of a marching band!
applejack How'd you do that?
applejack 
applejack And we came to cheer you to victory!
applejack Yes!
applejack Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
applejack Hmm.. Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet? The competition's almost over.
applejack Oh, don't worry about it kiddo.
applejack We're almost there, youngin's.
applejack Here we are.
applejack Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.  Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC.
applejack Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... Waaah!  Uh... house cleanin'?
applejack [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack [Birds chirping]
applejack [All gasp]
applejack Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?
applejack Theme song?
applejack Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!
applejack The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
applejack Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.
applejack Uh... Yeah.
applejack Uh...
applejack "Speechless" is right.
applejack Apple Bloom! You did it!
applejack Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
applejack Well, that sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that their hole and we'll save Rarity.
applejack We can't muscle through it!
applejack Huh. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
applejack We gotta save her.
applejack Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
applejack Hoho there, lover boy.
applejack Hold on there, little fella.
applejack Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
applejack Ho, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
applejack Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!
applejack Assist you with what?
applejack An' that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, “Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.” So she sang her song, big an' strong, an' they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... End.
applejack Heh... Uh... Well, ya know, being replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... An' Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
applejack But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
applejack Who you calling a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
applejack  They've got Bloomberg!
applejack Braeburn, listen –
applejack Braeburn, listen, something terrible has happened –
applejack … Listen, Braeburn, I – Oof!
applejack But, Braeburn, we –
applejack Braeburn!
applejack Braebu –
applejack Brae –
applejack BRAEBURN!
applejack You have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a HU-UGE problem! Some of our friends are missing!
applejack And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
applejack Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em. Let's go!
applejack Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?
applejack That's weird. 'cause my cousin, Braeburn, here, wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
applejack They busted their rumps here! An' now they're suppos't ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
applejack Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
applejack The settler ponies need it to LIVE!
applejack I want my kin ta have what they need to live... But a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
applejack Sheriff, if we could only –
applejack Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!
applejack Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.
applejack Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!
applejack What in tarnation?!
applejack Get back here, you thievin' varmints!
applejack Apple Bloom!
applejack I never told you that story?
applejack Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.
applejack  I didn't want to spend my life at a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in a big city. Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.
applejack  I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
applejack  What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.
applejack I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
applejack It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared.
applejack I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since. There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
applejack When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
applejack Come here, y'all.
applejack What's he all saddle sore about?
applejack Howdy!
applejack Are you kiddin’? Ah wouldn’t have missed it for the world.
applejack Hooie! Ah am beat! I haven’t danced that much since… Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!
applejack Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you ’round these parts?
applejack This afternoon? A-as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
applejack Uh, well, ah… ah… uh… ah don’t think I can make it ’cause… uh… ah have to… uh… uh, you know what? Ah… uh… pick apples! Yep, apples! ’Cause that’s what we do! With the… apples. We, uh… pick ’em! [nervous chuckle] 
applejack 
applejack 
applejack Oh! Howdy, pardn’r!
applejack No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean… you can’t come in here!
applejack Oh, well, she was just bringin’ in some… supplies! Yup, supplies for the… renovation! Fixin’ up the whole thing, top to bottom… uh, lots of construction goin’ on in there right now.
applejack Yup! Construction! That’s my story, and I’m stickin’ to it. [nervous laugh]
applejack [relieved sigh]
applejack [rest of ponies sigh in relief]
applejack [in unison] Surprise!
applejack Why in the world would you think we didn’t like you anymore, sugarcube?
applejack All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let’s party!
applejack Uh-huh, sure!
applejack Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
applejack Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
applejack We're gonna be a mite busy.
applejack At the Gala (it's amazing!), I will sell them (better hurry!)
applejack All my appletastic treats! (yummy, yummy!)
applejack Hungry ponies (they'll be snacking!), they will buy them (bring your money!)
applejack Caramel apples, apple sweets! (gimme some!)
applejack And I'll earn a lot of money for the Apple family!
applejack Sell some apples
applejack To sell!
applejack Howdy, partner! You hungry?
applejack Well, what's you're hungering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?
applejack Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yeehaw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.
applejack First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales.  This ain't what I expected at all.
applejack ...let it slip by.
applejack Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
applejack It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered.
applejack Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
applejack Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
applejack As horrible as our night was...
applejack Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!
applejack Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
applejack And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
applejack So you know who we are, big deal.
applejack What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started?
applejack Yee-haw!
applejack What in tarnation? Where am I?
applejack Who are y'all?
applejack All right then, I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?
applejack No! Our friendship? Over?!
applejack It can't be true. It just can't!
applejack That just can't be the truth.
applejack I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
applejack Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going.
applejack I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie.
applejack 
applejack Chocolate milk.
applejack Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us.
applejack Our friendship...over?
applejack Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
applejack Uh...Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
applejack Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that.
applejack I absolutely refuse.
applejack I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike.
applejack I don't have any book.
applejack Beats me.
applejack 
applejack Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
applejack I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
applejack And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me.
applejack Oh, now you want to fight. Where were you when I was battlin' Discord?
applejack Wh-what happened? Twilight!  I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?
applejack She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
applejack The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
applejack Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!
applejack That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
applejack Yes ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D.
applejack I'd take cover if I were you.
applejack You alright, hun?
applejack [various shock statements]
applejack Yes?
applejack Yes?
applejack Yes?
applejack [sighs of relief]
applejack 
applejack No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
applejack Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
applejack Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
applejack Not almost!
applejack Whoa nelly.
applejack Uh, What are we gonna do, y'all?
applejack It wasn't her fault!
applejack So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
applejack Mmhmm.
applejack [All right, etc]
applejack 
applejack Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter. [clears throat]
applejack Dear Princess Celestia, we're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
applejack Signed, your loyal subjects.
applejack 
applejack Howdy Spike, hey Twilight! Nice costume.
applejack With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
applejack While y'all here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
applejack [cheering and applauding]
applejack Whoop. Careful there, partner. 
applejack "Fit in"? Really?
applejack I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
applejack You can do it, princess!
applejack Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria, princess.
applejack Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
applejack What are you gonna do?
applejack Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?
applejack 'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
applejack Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
applejack It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?
applejack Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do.
applejack Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!
applejack Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!
applejack 
applejack Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!
applejack [more laughing]
applejack Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
applejack Together!
applejack Apple Bloom! You're up!
applejack Apple Bloom...
applejack How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
applejack Apple Bloom!
applejack Yee-haw!
applejack Way to corral some critters, sis!
applejack What?!
applejack H- Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.
applejack Yeah, um-
applejack Heh, um, actually, I-
applejack  Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
applejack But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
applejack He sure is a cutie.
applejack It's almost time!
applejack AB and I figured since we do this every year...
applejack Sister for a day.
applejack [deep breath]
applejack  We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
applejack Mm-hmm.
applejack Yeah!
applejack 
applejack 
applejack [more cheering]
applejack Yee haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right Big McIntosh?
applejack I've never seen anythin' like it, have you Big Mac?
applejack Why Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
applejack Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?
applejack  What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? Three cutie marks?!
applejack C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!
applejack Well I know somepony who might!
applejack Cutie pox?!
applejack Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!
applejack No known cure?!
applejack My sister's speakin' in fancy!
applejack I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
applejack Zecora!
applejack Hurry, hurry!
applejack But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
applejack Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!
applejack Come again?
applejack Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
applejack Somepony! Anypony!
applejack I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
applejack What?!
applejack Let's get this thing started!
applejack Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.
applejack Same time every week.
applejack Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us...
applejack I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
applejack Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
applejack Tortoise!
applejack It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
applejack A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.
applejack [camera clicks]
applejack [tortoise yelps]
applejack Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
applejack And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
applejack [ponies cheering]
applejack Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
applejack Immorta-what?
applejack [camera clicking]
applejack Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
applejack And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
applejack I stopped the carriage bus with these babies. Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
applejack But a real hero doesn't brag.
applejack ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
applejack I think we're getting off topic here.
applejack Listen to her. She's so excited to see us she can hardly talk.
applejack How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?
applejack You bet they are, birthday boy.
applejack C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
applejack Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?
applejack  Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh.
applejack Twilight, get my rope.
applejack Help!
applejack Get us out of here right now!
applejack  What was that?
applejack Whooowee! Canterlot, here we come!
applejack There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
applejack It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
applejack The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
applejack Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?
applejack Uh-
applejack Ugh.
applejack [under her breath] That'd be a first.
applejack Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we--
applejack Actually, we're all out.
applejack [under her breath] Where should I start?
applejack It feels like we're going in circles.
applejack Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and-
applejack Yeah, uh-
applejack Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship, heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down.
applejack You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
applejack Secretary.
applejack Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.
applejack And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food.
applejack How about 'Earth'?
applejack I agree. Let's all calm down.
applejack I know, I know.
applejack  
applejack [windigo roaring]
applejack 
applejack Windigos?
applejack Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too.
applejack 
applejack [windigo snorts]
applejack 
applejack Well, I don't hate you guys either.
applejack No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.
applejack [ice cracking]
applejack I didn't know unicorns could do that.
applejack Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings.
applejack 
applejack [pots and pans banging, continues under]
applejack Yay, the zap apples are comin'!
applejack 
applejack There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
applejack [springing sounds]
applejack I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen.
applejack I'm sorry Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
applejack The zap apple harvest has begun!
applejack 
applejack So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
applejack Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
applejack 
applejack 
applejack Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
applejack Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus, and the other one a unicorn?
applejack Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm a' hungry caterpillars headed this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
applejack 
applejack [tap on wood]
applejack Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so.
applejack Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches.
applejack Buuut, this here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.
applejack You betcha, Granny Smith.
applejack You betcha, Mayor.
applejack I'll do better than my best!
applejack Guess that means me.
applejack Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
applejack Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.
applejack Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?
applejack Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.
applejack No big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.
applejack Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing A-okay.
applejack Well I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!
applejack Sure am, Miss Jubilee.
applejack What are you all doing here?
applejack Fine.
applejack What are you five up to?
applejack Uhuh. Well, just remember: No talking about Ponyville.
applejack Canterlot was fine.
applejack Yes.
applejack Some.
applejack Yes, saw 'em both.
applejack Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.
applejack Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation being orchard folk and all.
applejack Yes.
applejack No, 'cuz it was none of her business!
applejack No!
applejack NO!
applejack [gears turning]
applejack No no NO! I'm not telling you why, so just–
applejack You promise not to ask me any questions?
applejack That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherry changa.
applejack No! Make it stop, make it stop!
applejack Never!
applejack Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.
applejack  I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
applejack 
applejack Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!
applejack Whoa! What the hay?
applejack Hey! Cut that out! Whoa! [to coach ponies] I'll pay you double to outrun them.
applejack I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
applejack [horses neighing, engine revving]
applejack Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!
applejack Pinkie, I did not break my promise!
applejack If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come to breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
applejack I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't.
applejack Yes. Hyah!
applejack [train whistle]
applejack 
applejack Yee-haw!
applejack Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts.
applejack Fine. Now you know.
applejack Well, just look!
applejack Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.
applejack That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come back empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.
applejack So... you're not upset, or disappointed?
applejack But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
applejack Dear Princess Celestia, it's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
applejack [through megaphone] Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!
applejack Heh, Sorry everypony! That's it for today!
applejack Hold on everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-
applejack And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
applejack If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
applejack What in Equestria is that?
applejack 
applejack Uh, sure, I guess.
applejack I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way.
applejack Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
applejack Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
applejack You wouldn't dare.
applejack I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
applejack You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
applejack Our cider speaks for itself!
applejack We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
applejack [sounds of exertion]
applejack Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
applejack Thanks Twilight. We'll need it.
applejack Ready!
applejack Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel!
applejack 
applejack [dings and buzzes]
applejack C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
applejack Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!
applejack I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
applejack Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!
applejack There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
applejack Thanks.
applejack We... lost?
applejack No Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal.
applejack Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.
applejack Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay.
applejack They're gone.
applejack Dear Princess Celestia. I wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already too.
applejack 
applejack [whooshing noises]
applejack  Is she gonna be okay?
applejack I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
applejack Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
applejack Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
applejack Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
applejack What's all the ruckus?
applejack There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus-
applejack ...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
applejack What kind of disaster?
applejack The perimeter's clear.
applejack  Me neither.
applejack  You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
applejack  What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?
applejack 
applejack But why would you want to, Spike?
applejack [voice vibrating] You said it, ooh.
applejack She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!
applejack “Applejack, asleep on the job!” Can y'all believe this?! And this one: “Big McIntosh – what's he hiding?” Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?
applejack Yup.
applejack Nope.
applejack Uh, beg pardon but, could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy, right Big McIntosh?
applejack Phooey on the festivities, I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
applejack 
applejack Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.
applejack Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
applejack What is it?
applejack Uh, you're investigatin'?
applejack 
applejack [running footsteps]
applejack Well, color me pleased as punch!
applejack Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight, that's great news!
applejack As one of your P.F.F.'s...  Pony Friends Forever...
applejack ... I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
applejack Why the long face, sugarcube?
applejack Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.
applejack And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
applejack Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bitesize apple fritter you ever tasted...
applejack Hiya, Princess!
applejack Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
applejack Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go?  I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
applejack 
applejack Spike! That goes on the cake.
applejack Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
applejack Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
applejack She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love love love it if we'd fill in for them.
applejack And you had your doubts about her.
applejack [excited chatter]
applejack Ya sure about that?
applejack C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess.
applejack I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
applejack Rarity!
applejack OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!
applejack Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
applejack I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considering.
applejack 
applejack Twilight! Did you pass?
applejack Made sweets with crystal berries
applejack Oh, we have to get this right
applejack Yes we have to make them see
applejack We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
applejack Oh, we have to get this right
applejack Yes we have to make them see
applejack We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
applejack Can you handle the mission?
