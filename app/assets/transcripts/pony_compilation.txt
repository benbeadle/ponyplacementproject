applejack the grand galloping gala! 
applejack woo-hoo!
applejack nice? it's a heap good more than just nice. i'd love to go. land sakes, if i had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles till the cows came home. do you have any idea how much business i could drum up for sweet apple acres? why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. we could replace that saggy old roof, and big mcintosh could replace that saggy old plow, and granny smith could replace that saggy old hip. why, i'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
applejack rainbow dash, you told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. what were you busy doing, spyin'?
applejack hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.  i asked for that ticket first.

applejack are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?

applejack land sakes!
applejack [squeaky toy]
applejack who's this gilda i've heard nothing about?
applejack spittin' snakes. hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
applejack hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. let's play.

applejack your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. we're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
applejack mm-hmm.
applejack what in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in equestria?
applejack huh?

applejack [pop whistles]
applejack let's go!

applejack that's it.
applejack everypony okay?
applejack aw, no big whoop, sugar cube.
applejack wha! wha...
applejack what's that, sugarcube?
applejack all of us are scared of that dragon.
applejack almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. so, get in there with twilight and show her what you're made of.
applejack now what?
applejack what in tarnation...?
applejack twilight! you gotta come see this! she's just five away from a new pony record!
applejack just take the broken limbs down, rarity. don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
applejack yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
applejack think more practical-like, will ya? they accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.
applejack [rain pouring down]
applejack ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
applejack uh, there. hunker down to yer heart's content whilst i finish things.
applejack what now?
applejack guh. there is just no pleasin' ya, is there? everything's got to be just so.
applejack y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
applejack does so.
applejack does so.
applejack does so.
applejack does so infinity. hah.
applejack i reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
applejack i'm not sayin' anythin'.
applejack y'all just be on yer way, then.
applejack uh-huh, perhaps we should. and fast.

applejack what in tarnation... now wait just a goll-darn minute. ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?
applejack slumber 101: everything you... oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. i gotta skidaddle on home quick. i'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. uh, g'night.  or maybe i'll sit here for a spell.
applejack blahch. what in the world is this for?
applejack puffiness-schmuffiness! that's good eatin'!
applejack of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, i reckon?
applejack you betcha. 
applejack you know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
applejack yay.
applejack just fine, rarity.
applejack me! i'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. oo-oo! i'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
applejack that's not a real story. you made it up.
applejack nah, ya just eat 'em.  mmm-mmm! 
applejack aw, i was just about to, but you interrupted me. pardon.
applejack oh yeah? well i dare rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.

applejack i dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
applejack hah!

applejack : will!
applejack i've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
applejack no, it was me.
applejack me!
applejack ya see? that's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
applejack outta my way, missy! time's a-wastin'.
applejack no waitin'! no stoppin'! doin'! and that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
applejack well, ya should'a tried harder.  i'm mighty sorry, twilight.

applejack we gotta do somethin'!
applejack rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! i said hussle over here and help me! look, i'm sorry, alright?
applejack i said i'm sorry! i should'a listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. but right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! please!
applejack consarnit! what the... eh... you... i mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. but y'all need to get over it, on account i just can't fix this mess i made myself. i need your help.
applejack better?
applejack is it bigger than a barn?
applejack we're never gonna guess what y'er thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.
applejack she means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
applejack is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
applejack it is?
applejack if only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
applejack sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
applejack that's kind of ya to say, but i'm the one who's sorry.
applejack ugh. are not.

applejack [all gasp]
applejack [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack apple bloom! i told you never to say that name.
applejack no good reason? you call protectin' yer kin no good reason? why, as soon as my sister saw zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
applejack so i swept her up and brought her here.
applejack for safe keepin'.
applejack not from that creepy zecora.
applejack born where? i've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept.... her!
applejack that's just it, she lives in... the everfree forest!
applejack [crash that sounds like a thunderclap]
applejack the everfree forest just ain't natural. the plants grow...
applejack all on their own!
applejack apple bloom! hush and let the big ponies talk.
applejack hey! where's apple bloom?
applejack that silly lil' filly! i told her to stay put!
applejack apple bloom?
applejack you get back here right now!
applejack y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
applejack [applejack, rainbow dash, pinkie pie, and rarity speak over each other against zecora]
applejack and you! why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
applejack who knows what kind of nasty curse zecora could have just put on you?
applejack just you wait, twilight. you're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.
applejack [dream sequence]
applejack just you wait, twilight; some pony tales really are true.
applejack [high pitched voice] i hate to say i told ya so, twilight, but i told ya so!
applejack [spike and twilight gasp]
applejack it's a curse, i tells ya!
applejack good gravy, girl! what's wrong with you?!
applejack i agree with dash! we'll go to zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
applejack now where does she think she's goin' this time?
applejack stop right there! turn around right now, missy!
applejack no?! you can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
applejack apple bloom, you come back here right this instant! i'm gonna tell big mcintosh on you! aw pony feathers.
applejack rainbow! thank celestia! there's no time to lose! i need to get to zecora's pronto! giddyup pony!
applejack yeee-haw!

applejack i'm comin' for ya, apple bloom!
applejack whoa there. easy, rainbow crash.
applejack apple bloom! you're okay!
applejack what in the hay does that mean?
applejack ... will somepony please talk normal?
applejack little jokes?! very funny.
applejack i'm right here little sis. i ain't tiny no more!
applejack here's all those apples you wanted, fluttershy, but i still can't figure why y'need so many. hey!
applejack i'll rastle 'em up, but i need everypony's help to do it. twilight, you and rarity wait over there. i'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. rainbow dash, you and fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
applejack yeeeeeee-haw!
applejack alright y'all, here goes nothin'. look out rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. keep a lead on 'em, rainbow dash. hold on girls, we're almost there.
applejack forget her ladies. focus. head 'em up and move 'em out.
applejack couldn't a'done it without y'all.
applejack looks like our problems are solved.
applejack come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. she's a few apples short of a bushel.
applejack my apples!
applejack no woodland creature's gonna eat the apple family's crop.
applejack brace yourself y'all, here they come.  didn't see that one comin'.
applejack so you knew what those critters were all along, huh pinkie pie?
applejack but the food we've stored is runnin' out
applejack and we can't grow in this cold
applejack 'cause tomorrow springâ
applejack no easy task to clear the ground
applejack plant our tiny seeds
applejack with proper care and sunshine
applejack everyone it feeds
applejack apples, carrots, celery stalks
applejack colorful flowers too
applejack we must work so very hard
applejack it's just so much to do!
applejack keep pushin', caramel. that's it bumpkin, i know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. yee-haw!
applejack oh, just dandy. little slow startin', but peachy all the same. there's a lot of ground to clear ya hear. we can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow high-tailed outta here.
applejack well, i... i dunno twilight.
applejack well, i never turn down a hard worker but...
applejack hmm. she's awful strong for such a little pony.
applejack and what in tarnation does that mean?
applejack what's going on? wha'd'ya do? you used magic, didn't you?
applejack nuts twilight, you used magic.
applejack that's not how we do it 'round here, twilight, and especially not on mah farm.
applejack rainbow dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
applejack i'm tellin' you rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
applejack go.
applejack go.
applejack go!
applejack and it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
applejack oh good gravy, caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
applejack spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
applejack don't get your mane in a tangle. you'll get your cutie mark. every pony gets one eventually.
applejack 'course you can. y'know, i was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and i couldn't be prouder of it. i know my future was to run sweet apple acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.  come to think of it, granny smith was the last one in her class, too. huh, same as big mcintosh.
applejack get your delicious nutritious apples here!
applejack heh... she's so creative, heh.
applejack you forgot your change!
applejack i'm sorry ma'am. ma'am! aww... now apple bloom, you can't just...
applejack apple bloom! i am really really sorry about that. she's new. here, take these. no charge. ...and these. ...and these.
applejack y'all come back now, y'hear?
applejack sorry little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
applejack home. now.
applejack ugh. listen sugar-cube, i know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
applejack do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
applejack well there you go. bet you and twist would have a great time together. now run along and find your friend.
applejack yeah. i'm sure.
applejack [knock on the door]
applejack apple bloom, you made it. after i heard about twist, i was afraid you wouldn't show up. i sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. these things happen when these things are supposed to happen. trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. i'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
applejack and they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
applejack [ponies chatter]
applejack hoo-wee! not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
applejack i know i can.  oh, for pete's sake!
applejack all right, all right. you got another throw there, pony girl.
applejack wow, rainbow, heh. you couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw.
applejack yee-haw! it's a ringer. that's how you do it down here on the farm.
applejack ah, don't feel bad, rainbow. it's all in good fun.
applejack besides, you're a mighty good athlete. i'm just better, heh heh heh.
applejack well, i was gonna say in all of equestria, but that might be gilding the lily.
applejack prove what?
applejack you know what, rainbow? you're on.

applejack hah! prove it.
applejack tomorrow is the annual runnin' of the leaves. i challenge you to race me in it.
applejack hold on! there is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
applejack the iron phony, you mean.
applejack i'm ready to run a good, clean race.
applejack you are not allowed to use your wings.
applejack trussed up like a turkey. well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
applejack 'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
applejack twilight? what in tarnation are you doin' up here?
applejack but have you ever run a race?
applejack well, i think that's just dandy, twilight. good luck. 
applejack not so easy without wings, is it?
applejack whoa! i don't believe it.

applejack why, that little cheater did that on purpose. it's on.
applejack later!
applejack er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... rainbow. mind giving me a lift?
applejack no, i said no wings.
applejack whoa!
applejack you do?
applejack cut it out!
applejack you started it.
applejack oh no, you won't.
applejack oh no, you don't.
applejack no, i won!
applejack tied?!
applejack for first?
applejack last?
applejack you?
applejack what? how's that even possible?
applejack you're right, twilight. our behavior was just terrible.
applejack princess celestia?!
applejack w... what are you doin' here?
applejack i'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport, princess.
applejack why, princess, i bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. whaddya say, friend? wanna go for another run?
applejack howdy, rarity!
applejack what do you think she's makin'?
applejack well, that makes sense. since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
applejack gown? shoot. i was just gonna wear my old work duds.
applejack hm... nah.
applejack okay, sure. why not? since you're up for it and all. just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
applejack so all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? and lickety split?
applejack they sure are... sumth'n.
applejack and we're plum grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
applejack are you sure? i mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
applejack what if it rains? galoshes!
applejack even if you simply have to fudge it
applejack why, they're the best duds i ever did see.
applejack whoa, nelly! you could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. your business will be boomin'!
applejack why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
applejack nah.  okay, maybe a little.
applejack well, we can't just leave rarity like this.
applejack thanks to fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
applejack well, that's mighty big of you.
applejack oh, right. that.
applejack uh, twilight? why are you hanging out in a ditch?
applejack twitchy tail? pinkie sense? woah! nyu-uh!
applejack i know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.
applejack twilight! you came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. twi? you okay? uh, twi?
applejack takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. how 'bout you pinkie? whatchu doin'?
applejack that's where fluttershy's headed!
applejack we better go and make sure she's okay.
applejack i hope nothin'.
applejack i'm tryin' not to think about it.
applejack just exploded? for no reason?
applejack of course not.
applejack i hope you're right, for fluttershy's sake. look! there's froggy bottom bog!
applejack [dragonfly buzzing]
applejack fluttershy?
applejack phew, what a relief.
applejack um... twilight?
applejack who cares? run!
applejack [ponies screaming]
applejack what are you talking about pink?
applejack golly. i'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
applejack and rainbow dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
applejack nervous? have you spit yer bit or somethin'? she was tootin' her own horn louder then the brass section of a marching band!
applejack how'd you do that?
applejack and we came to cheer you to victory!
applejack yes!
applejack since we're up here, i'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
applejack hmm.. wonder how come we haven't seen rainbow dash or rarity yet? the competition's almost over.
applejack oh, don't worry about it kiddo.
applejack we're almost there, youngin's.
applejack here we are.
applejack cutie mark crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.  well, don't thank me all at once. this was my clubhouse when i was your age. sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. and it's all yours. it just needs a little, uh... tlc.
applejack well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... waaah!  uh... house cleanin'?
applejack [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
applejack [birds chirping]
applejack [all gasp]
applejack well, uh... i'll be, cutie mark crusaders. you've done one fine job with this place. so, what's next?
applejack theme song?
applejack well okay then! sounds like you have a plan. i gotta, uh... leave no apple unpicked! see y'all later!
applejack the talent show is just around the corner. i wonder how the fillies are doin'.
applejack well, gosh. sure wasn't expectin' that.
applejack uh... yeah.
applejack uh...
applejack "speechless" is right.
applejack apple bloom! you did it!
applejack not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
applejack well, that sounds mighty easy. just take us to that their hole and we'll save rarity.
applejack we can't muscle through it!
applejack huh. heavens to betsy. now i'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off but rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
applejack we gotta save her.
applejack don't mean we can't dig 'em out. come on!
applejack hoho there, lover boy.
applejack hold on there, little fella.
applejack guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
applejack ho, doggies. if you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. come on, ponies! kick 'em up, kick 'em out. buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
applejack yeehaw! get along, little doggies!
applejack assist you with what?
applejack an' that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, âhmm. my favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.â so she sang her song, big an' strong, an' they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. the... end.
applejack heh... uh... well, ya know, being replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... an' bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
applejack but bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. he needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in appleloosa.
applejack who you calling a baby?! bloomberg's no baby! don't wet widdle rarity make you all saddy-waddy. bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. yes, he is. a-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
applejack they've got bloomberg!
applejack braeburn, listen â
applejack braeburn, listen, something terrible has happened â
applejack â¦ listen, braeburn, i â oof!
applejack but, braeburn, we â
applejack braeburn!
applejack braebu â
applejack brae â
applejack braeburn!
applejack you have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a hu-uge problem! some of our friends are missing!
applejack and we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
applejack sorry, rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em. let's go!
applejack oh, yeah? 'bout what?
applejack that's weird. 'cause my cousin, braeburn, here, wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
applejack they busted their rumps here! an' now they're suppos't ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
applejack where?! it's the only flatland around these parts!
applejack the settler ponies need it to live!
applejack i want my kin ta have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. and i don't like the look of it.
applejack sheriff, if we could only â
applejack bloomberg, this is yer special day. mama's so proud of you!
applejack uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? and which am i supposed to eat first? oh, never mind. i'm not hungry.
applejack now i can eat someth'n! i'm starved!
applejack what in tarnation?!
applejack get back here, you thievin' varmints!
applejack apple bloom!
applejack i never told you that story?
applejack why, shoot. i was just a little filly. even littler than y'all.
applejack i didn't want to spend my life at a muddy old apple farm. i wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my aunt n' uncle orange. so i set out to try my luck in a big city. manehattan! the most cosmopolitan city in all of equestria.
applejack i knew i'd find out who i was meant to be in manehattan.
applejack what's he talking about? what do i say? i don't wanna look like a fool.
applejack i never felt so homesick in all my days as i did right then.
applejack it was amazin'! a rainbow pointin' right back to... home. in that moment, it all became clear. i knew right then just who i was supposed to be. that's when this here appeared.
applejack i've been happily workin' in the farm ever since. there they are! get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
applejack when i got my cutie mark, i saw a rainbow that pointed me home. i bet it was your sonic rainboom!
applejack come here, y'all.
applejack what's he all saddle sore about?
applejack howdy!
applejack are you kiddinâ? ah wouldnât have missed it for the world.
applejack hooie! ah am beat! i havenât danced that much sinceâ¦ well, since your last party. thanks again for the invite!
applejack huh? oh, hi, pinkie pie! what brings you âround these parts?
applejack this afternoon? a-as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
applejack uh, well, ahâ¦ ahâ¦ uhâ¦ ah donât think i can make it âcauseâ¦ uhâ¦ ah have toâ¦ uhâ¦ uh, you know what? ahâ¦ uhâ¦ pick apples! yep, apples! âcause thatâs what we do! with theâ¦ apples. we, uhâ¦ pick âem! [nervous chuckle] 
applejack oh! howdy, pardnâr!
applejack no! uh, i mean, yes, i meanâ¦ you canât come in here!
applejack oh, well, she was just bringinâ in someâ¦ supplies! yup, supplies for theâ¦ renovation! fixinâ up the whole thing, top to bottomâ¦ uh, lots of construction goinâ on in there right now.
applejack yup! construction! thatâs my story, and iâm stickinâ to it. [nervous laugh]
applejack [relieved sigh]
applejack [rest of ponies sigh in relief]
applejack [in unison] surprise!
applejack why in the world would you think we didnât like you anymore, sugarcube?
applejack all right, girls! enough of this gab. letâs party!
applejack uh-huh, sure!
applejack hold your horses, girl. we're here.
applejack dressed? uh, beg pardon, rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
applejack we're gonna be a mite busy.
applejack at the gala (it's amazing!), i will sell them (better hurry!)
applejack all my appletastic treats! (yummy, yummy!)
applejack hungry ponies (they'll be snacking!), they will buy them (bring your money!)
applejack caramel apples, apple sweets! (gimme some!)
applejack and i'll earn a lot of money for the apple family!
applejack sell some apples
applejack to sell!
applejack howdy, partner! you hungry?
applejack well, what's you're hungering for? caramel apple? apple pie? apple fritter? apple fries?
applejack well, thank you kindly, sir! yeehaw! in the first minute, i made my first sale. just like i expected.
applejack first minute, first sale. second... fourth... sixth... sixtieth minute... no sales.  this ain't what i expected at all.
applejack ...let it slip by.
applejack two apple fritters comin' right up. that'll be four bits.
applejack it's okay, rarity. i got you covered.
applejack well, no wonder nopony wants my food. they're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. i'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
applejack okay, all you high-class ponies. here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
applejack as horrible as our night was...
applejack rainbow dash, what's going on with this rain? i mean chocolate milk? i mean chocolate milk rain?!
applejack fluttershy! do somethin'!
applejack and when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
applejack so you know who we are, big deal.
applejack what do you reckon he meant? twists and turns and ending back where we started?
applejack yee-haw!
applejack what in tarnation? where am i?
applejack who are y'all?
applejack all right then, i don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but i've got a really bad feelin' about this feller discord. what's gonna come of this mission we're on?
applejack no! our friendship? over?!
applejack it can't be true. it just can't!
applejack that just can't be the truth.
applejack i was talking to... uh... nopony! nopony whatsoever!
applejack nothing. come on, uh, we best be going.
applejack i didn't notice anything strange about pinkie.
applejack chocolate milk.
applejack well, looky there. rainbow dash is flying away. she's abandonin' us.
applejack our friendship...over?
applejack nopony! nopony whatsoever.
applejack uh...rarity? this here diamond of yours? twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
applejack wow, i can see so much better now. whoa! i meant to do that.
applejack i absolutely refuse.
applejack i guess you just bring out the worst in us, spike.
applejack i don't have any book.
applejack beats me.
applejack mine's workin'. there must be somethin' wrong with yours.
applejack i better go, too. i've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
applejack and so i tried to defeat discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me.
applejack oh, now you want to fight. where were you when i was battlin' discord?
applejack wh-what happened? twilight!  i saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. i couldn't face the truth, so i started tellin' lies. can you ever forgive me?
applejack she could be anywhere by now! we're never gonna find her.
applejack the same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
applejack rarity, pinkie, hold on! y'all are slowing her down!
applejack that's right. you couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
applejack yes ma'am. i wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. hehe. now get back to it, r.d.
applejack i'd take cover if i were you.
applejack you alright, hun?
applejack [various shock statements]
applejack yes?
applejack yes?
applejack yes?
applejack [sighs of relief]
applejack no offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
applejack come on now. have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
applejack y'all hear that? what in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
applejack not almost!
applejack whoa nelly.
applejack uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?
applejack it wasn't her fault!
applejack so when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
applejack mmhmm.
applejack [all right, etc]
applejack y'all heard the princess. spike, take a letter. [clears throat]
applejack dear princess celestia, we're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
applejack signed, your loyal subjects.
applejack howdy spike, hey twilight! nice costume.
applejack with that beard, i reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
applejack while y'all here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
applejack [cheering and applauding]
applejack whoop. careful there, partner. 
applejack "fit in"? really?
applejack i mean... that's easy! all you gotta do is have the right attitude. loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
applejack you can do it, princess!
applejack why don't you try bobbin' for apples? we got the best apples in equestria, princess.
applejack shoot. we had everything goin' our way. luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
applejack what are you gonna do?
applejack come on, kids! doesn't that sound like fun?
applejack 'uncouth'? she said the sisterhooves social was 'uncouth'?
applejack honey, rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
applejack it means uncivil. y'know, bad mannered?
applejack exactly. sweetie belle, just give rarity some time. she'll come around. sisters always do.
applejack come on, now. apple bloom and i got some chores to finish up on. maybe you can help!
applejack oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. watch!
applejack good catch there, apple bloom! whoo!
applejack [more laughing]
applejack since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
applejack together!
applejack apple bloom! you're up!
applejack apple bloom...
applejack how d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
applejack apple bloom!
applejack yee-haw!
applejack way to corral some critters, sis!
applejack what?!
applejack h- hold on, sweetie belle. don't get ahead of yourself here.
applejack yeah, um-
applejack heh, um, actually, i-
applejack oh rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. bein' sisters is a give and take. you've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
applejack but ya never give in. bein' sisters is like... apple pie. you can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
applejack he sure is a cutie.
applejack it's almost time!
applejack ab and i figured since we do this every year...
applejack sister for a day.
applejack [deep breath]
applejack we switched places over at the very first mudhole.
applejack mm-hmm.
applejack yeah!
applejack [more cheering]
applejack yee haw, little sis! congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! we're mighty proud of you, right big mcintosh?
applejack i've never seen anythin' like it, have you big mac?
applejack why apple bloom, i think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
applejack night! oh my, little apple bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, big mac?
applejack what in tarnation is that? apple bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? three cutie marks?!
applejack c'mere, you! ow! ow! whoa!
applejack well i know somepony who might!
applejack cutie pox?!
applejack yes, but what's the cure? what's the cure?!
applejack no known cure?!
applejack my sister's speakin' in fancy!
applejack i know she needs help! we can't just wait for this to go away! we gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! and fast!
applejack zecora!
applejack hurry, hurry!
applejack but magically you're here! was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
applejack well, well then give 'em to her! quick!
applejack come again?
applejack well then let's get to it! alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
applejack somepony! anypony!
applejack i sure am proud of you, sis. seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
applejack what?!
applejack let's get this thing started!
applejack why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' pony pet playdate in this park.
applejack same time every week.
applejack eeexactly. so, if'n you'll excuse us...
applejack i got one. does she understand what a pet really needs?
applejack great galloping galoshes! there's been an avalanche in there!
applejack tortoise!
applejack it sure was, if'n it means rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
applejack a falcon sure looks good on ya, rainbow.
applejack [camera clicks]
applejack [tortoise yelps]
applejack wouldja look at that? he even smiles slow.
applejack and i bet 'modest' is not one of them.
applejack [ponies cheering]
applejack awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
applejack immorta-what?
applejack [camera clicking]
applejack gotta hand it to the girl, that mare do well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
applejack and she's modest and humble. she lets her actions speak for themselves. gotta admire that.
applejack i stopped the carriage bus with these babies. bucky mcgillicuddy and kicks mcgee.
applejack but a real hero doesn't brag.
applejack ...rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
applejack i think we're getting off topic here.
applejack listen to her. she's so excited to see us she can hardly talk.
applejack how come y'all aren't doing any gardening? this is a garden party, isn't it?
applejack you bet they are, birthday boy.
applejack c'mon, spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. i'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
applejack now who in ponyville would steal my apples? for that matter, who would steal my leaves?
applejack oh, that's a good one, twilight. sweet little spike, running wild. ha, what a laugh.
applejack twilight, get my rope.
applejack help!
applejack get us out of here right now!
applejack what was that?
applejack whooowee! canterlot, here we come!
applejack there's so much to look at! i feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
applejack it's a reenactment of the founding of equestria. it's not the 'rainbow dash show'.
applejack the hearth's warming eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
applejack wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, chancellor?
applejack uh-
applejack ugh.
applejack [under her breath] that'd be a first.
applejack aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? shoot... i really thought we could get through to 'em if we--
applejack actually, we're all out.
applejack [under her breath] where should i start?
applejack it feels like we're going in circles.
applejack absolutely not, your chancellorness. it's just that there are holes in the map, and-
applejack yeah, uh-
applejack heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship, heh. it's just that... the map is also upside down.
applejack you're right! it's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
applejack secretary.
applejack yes, chancellor puddinghead.
applejack and fertile, too. perfect for growing food.
applejack how about 'earth'?
applejack i agree. let's all calm down.
applejack i know, i know.
applejack [windigo roaring]
applejack windigos?
applejack then... this is our fault. we three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. now it's destroyin' this land, too.
applejack [windigo snorts]
applejack well, i don't hate you guys either.
applejack no matter what our differences, we're all ponies.
applejack [ice cracking]
applejack i didn't know unicorns could do that.
applejack don't blame me. rainbow dash should've flown up there and shut it. after all, she's got wings.
applejack [pots and pans banging, continues under]
applejack yay, the zap apples are comin'!
applejack there's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
applejack [springing sounds]
applejack i'm sorry, apple bloom. i already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. you know what'll happen.
applejack i'm sorry apple bloom, but don't you fret. granny smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
applejack the zap apple harvest has begun!
applejack so i take it family appreciation day went well?
applejack who wants to help granny sing to the water?
applejack can you believe the new baby is finally here?
applejack now how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus, and the other one a unicorn?
applejack babysit? now? when there's a swarm a' hungry caterpillars headed this way? i gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
applejack [tap on wood]
applejack aw shucks, apple bloom. i sure hope so.
applejack oh, shucks. i'm not much for speeches.
applejack buuut, this here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since i was a little little pony. so it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. i promise to make ponyville proud.
applejack you betcha, granny smith.
applejack you betcha, mayor.
applejack i'll do better than my best!
applejack guess that means me.
applejack darn tootin'! see y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
applejack huh, some ponies. sheesh.
applejack uh, hey, everypony. what's up?
applejack aw shucks, miss jubilee. you don't have to go into all that.
applejack no big deal, guys. i thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so i took the job and came here. that's it. end of story.
applejack sorry, but that's all there is to tell. thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. tell my family hi, and that i'm doing a-okay.
applejack well i didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! there is nothin' to tell and i am not going back to ponyville!
applejack sure am, miss jubilee.
applejack what are you all doing here?
applejack fine.
applejack what are you five up to?
applejack uhuh. well, just remember: no talking about ponyville.
applejack canterlot was fine.
applejack yes.
applejack some.
applejack yes, saw 'em both.
applejack um, well, miss jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. real good treats.
applejack cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. we struck up a conversation being orchard folk and all.
applejack yes.
applejack no, 'cuz it was none of her business!
applejack no!
applejack no!
applejack [gears turning]
applejack no no no! i'm not telling you why, so justâ
applejack you promise not to ask me any questions?
applejack that kind of question is fine, pinkie. no, i-i never had a cherry changa.
applejack no! make it stop, make it stop!
applejack never!
applejack alright, alright! i'll tell everypony what's goin' on! just please stop talkin'! but... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? i'm plum tuckered out.
applejack i will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. pinkie promise.
applejack giddy up, fellas, i gotta get the heck out of dodge!
applejack whoa! what the hay?
applejack hey! cut that out! whoa! [to coach ponies] i'll pay you double to outrun them.
applejack i'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
applejack [horses neighing, engine revving]
applejack hyah! c'mon, y'all! go, go!
applejack pinkie, i did not break my promise!
applejack if y'all reckon back, i told you that i would tell you everything at breakfast. but i didn't come to breakfast. i couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
applejack i'm sorry, pinkie, but i can't tell y'all the truth. i just can't.
applejack yes. hyah!
applejack [train whistle]
applejack yee-haw!
applejack ha, try and catch me now. oh, nuts.
applejack fine. now you know.
applejack well, just look!
applejack don't you get it? there's every color of ribbon down there. every color... but... blue. i came in fourth, third, even second, but i didn't win one first prize, and i certainly didn't win any prize money.
applejack that's why i came here. i wanted to earn some money. after that big old send off ponyville gave me, i just didn't have the nerve to come back empty-hooved. i couldn't come home a failure.
applejack so... you're not upset, or disappointed?
applejack but what about the mayor? i don't think i can face her and tell her i didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
applejack dear princess celestia, it's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. but there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. you can't run away from your problems. better to run to your friends and family.
applejack [through megaphone] attention, everypony! cider season is now officially open!
applejack heh, sorry everypony! that's it for today!
applejack hold on everypony. we've done our best to improve supply this year-
applejack and it's always true. but apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in equestria. sorry, but that recipe takes time.
applejack if y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
applejack what in equestria is that?
applejack uh, sure, i guess.
applejack i just don't know, y'all. we've always made cider the same way.
applejack hold on. who gets the seventy five?
applejack cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. we'd lose sweet apple acres if we agreed to this.
applejack you wouldn't dare.
applejack i'm not so sure. they sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
applejack you can't sell that cider! that's made from apple family apples!
applejack our cider speaks for itself!
applejack we'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
applejack [sounds of exertion]
applejack me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
applejack thanks twilight. we'll need it.
applejack ready!
applejack great job, y'all! we've already filled an entire barrel!
applejack [dings and buzzes]
applejack c'mon, apple bloom, focus! we gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
applejack rest when it's over, big mcintosh! ride! ride!
applejack i think i'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
applejack keep it up, everypony! we're back in this!
applejack there's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
applejack thanks.
applejack we... lost?
applejack no rainbow dash. a deal's a deal.
applejack congratulations to y'all. the cider business in ponyville... is yours. c'mon, apples. let's go pack up our things.
applejack go ahead, everypony. go on, y'all. it's okay.
applejack they're gone.
applejack dear princess celestia. i wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] i didn't learn anythin'! ha! i was right all along! if you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. sure i could tell you i learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and i can count on them no matter what, but truth is, i knew that already too.
applejack [whooshing noises]
applejack is she gonna be okay?
applejack i bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
applejack is she serious? who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
applejack ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. you're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
applejack yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
applejack what's all the ruckus?
applejack there's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus-
applejack ...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
applejack what kind of disaster?
applejack the perimeter's clear.
applejack me neither.
applejack you'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
applejack what do ya think of that 'move', rainbow dash? still think they're lame?
applejack but why would you want to, spike?
applejack [voice vibrating] you said it, ooh.
applejack she's not mean, twilight, she's a hoot!
applejack âapplejack, asleep on the job!â can y'all believe this?! and this one: âbig mcintosh â what's he hiding?â who the hay does this gabby gums think she is?
applejack yup.
applejack nope.
applejack uh, beg pardon but, could we maybe move things along? this here cake's a mite heavy, right big mcintosh?
applejack phooey on the festivities, i can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
applejack yeah, i'm gonna hit the hay myself.
applejack yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
applejack what is it?
applejack uh, you're investigatin'?
applejack [running footsteps]
applejack well, color me pleased as punch!
applejack your brother's getting married? congratulations, twilight, that's great news!
applejack as one of your p.f.f.'s...  pony friends forever...
applejack ... i wanna tell you that i think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
applejack why the long face, sugarcube?
applejack come on, now. you're his sister. he'll always make time for you.
applejack and you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
applejack cake, check. ice sculpture, check. best darn bitesize apple fritter you ever tasted...
applejack hiya, princess!
applejack hiya, princess mi amore cadenza. you come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
applejack aw, shucks. why don't you take a few to go?  i know how you brides can be. so busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
applejack spike! that goes on the cake.
applejack aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
applejack think maybe you're being just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
applejack she didn't say. but she did tell us that she would love love love it if we'd fill in for them.
applejack and you had your doubts about her.
applejack [excited chatter]
applejack ya sure about that?
applejack c'mon, y'all. let's go check on the princess.
applejack i-i don't understand. how can there be two of 'em?
applejack rarity!
applejack ok, this is just gettin' weird. real me! real me!
applejack sorry, twi. we should've listened to you.
applejack i'd say she's handling things pretty well, considering.
applejack twilight! did you pass?
applejack made sweets with crystal berries
applejack oh, we have to get this right
applejack yes we have to make them see
applejack we can save the crystal ponies with their history
applejack oh, we have to get this right
applejack yes we have to make them see
applejack we can save the crystal ponies... with their history!
applejack can you handle the mission?rainbow [sheepish laughter] uh, 'scuse me? [more sheepish laughter]
rainbow lemme help you.
rainbow [rushing water]
rainbow [more sheepish laughter] oops, i guess i overdid it. um, uh, how about this? my very own patented rain-blow dry! no no, don't thank me, you're quite welcome. [bursts out laughing]
rainbow the one and only. why, you heard of me?
rainbow yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. i'll do it in a jiffy. just as soon as i'm done practicing.
rainbow the wonderbolts! they're gonna perform at the celebration tomorrow, and i'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
rainbow yep!
rainbow that's them!
rainbow hey, i could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
rainbow [sounds of exertion] loop the loop around, and wham! what'd i say? ten. seconds. flat. i'd never leave ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing]  you should see the look on your face. ha! you're a laugh, twilight sparkle. i can't wait to hang out some more.
rainbow what did you do with our princess?!
rainbow come back here!  nighttime? forever? where's she going?
rainbow and just what are the elements of harmony? and how did you know about nightmare moon, huh? are you a spy? whoa!
rainbow nopony knows. you know why?
rainbow 'cause every pony who's ever come in, has never come out.
rainbow fluttershy! quick!
rainbow and once pinkie and rarity were saved, whoosh... me and fluttershy loop-de-loop around and wham! caught you right in the nick of time.
rainbow i'm on it.
rainbow little?
rainbow right here... guh...
rainbow then what is?
rainbow oh, give me a break.
rainbow so would the mustache.
rainbow what's with you and falling off cliffs today?
rainbow duh.
rainbow who's there?
rainbow i ain't scared of you! show yourself!
rainbow who?
rainbow really?! i mean... oh yeah, me. hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause i've been trying to get into that group for like, ever.
rainbow yep.
rainbow yes.
rainbow yes,  it's all true.
rainbow woohoo! sign me up. just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
rainbow you... thank you! for the offer, i mean, but i'm afraid i have to say no.
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow see? i'd never leave my friends hangin'.
rainbow where's the sixth?
rainbow ugh, my head.
rainbow aw yeah.
rainbow whoa!  ugh. are we talking about the grand galloping gala?
rainbow no, i was busy napping, and i just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
rainbow yes! this is so awesome. the wonderbolts perform at the grand galloping gala every year. i can see it now. everyone would be watching the sky. their eyes riveted on the wonderbolts, but then in would fly rainbow dash!
rainbow [audience gasps]
rainbow i would draw their attention with my super speed strut.
rainbow [audience cheers]
rainbow then, i would mesmerize 'em with my fantastic filly flash. and for my grand finale, the buccaneer blaze! the ponies would go wild!
rainbow [ponies go wild]
rainbow the wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member. don't you see, twilight? this could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. you gotta take me! 
rainbow so? that doesn't mean you own it.
rainbow a chance to audition for the wonderbolts?
rainbow living the dream.
rainbow okay.
rainbow wait just a minute.
rainbow no. i mean, yes. i mean, maybe. look, it doesn't matter. i couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
rainbow your ticket?
rainbow hi there best friend forever i've ever ever had. enjoying the sunny weather?
rainbow whaddya you mean? i just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so i thought i'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
rainbow me? no no no, of course not.
rainbow seriously, i'd do it for any pony. heh heh, eh.
rainbow ugh, fine. 
rainbow yes! that means the ticket is mine. ha ha, [sing-song voice] i got the ticket, i got the ticket-- you know, i haven't perfected my signature moves for the wonderbolts anyway. i don't need that ticket either.
rainbow what a great way to apologize.
rainbow stampede!
rainbow [cows mooing]
rainbow [ponies panicking]
rainbow look there!
rainbow actually, i haven't seen her all week.
rainbow but she'll be here for sure. applejack is never late.
rainbow did you see applejack's slick moves out there? what an athlete. this week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and i know it's gonna be so awesome.
rainbow tired?
rainbow there you are.
rainbow see this contraption?
rainbow well, i'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than i can take off on my own. once i'm in the air, i'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the wonderbolts.
rainbow pfft, heh, not for a pony who can fly.
rainbow ready? one... two... three!
rainbow umm... maybe i wasn't clear. you're supposed to land on the other end.
rainbow applejack, what the hay is going on? i mean, i thought i was working with ponyville's best athlete!
rainbow ugh!
rainbow wait, applejaaaaack!
rainbow i think somepony else needs your help.
rainbow yep.
rainbow stampede!
rainbow [ponies scream]
rainbow phew! that applebucking sure made me hungry.
rainbow pinkie pie? not again.
rainbow not now, pinkie pie.
rainbow i'm in the middle of something.
rainbow i said not now--
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow phew. that was close.
rainbow aah!
rainbow aah!
rainbow waaa--oh, forget it.
rainbow okay.
rainbow pinkie pie!
rainbow i can think of one thing.
rainbow i didn't take you for a prankster, pinkie pie.
rainbow you know pinkie pie, you're not as annoying as i thought.
rainbow you wanna hang out?
rainbow a simple nod would do.
rainbow is she even home?
rainbow there she is.
rainbow [water splash]
rainbow fluttershy.
rainbow yeah, you're right.  huh. we need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. so, who's it gonna be?
rainbow oh, awesome. who? who? do i know them?
rainbow good one, pinkie pie.
rainbow ridiculous.
rainbow mornin', pinks. gilda, this is my gal pal, pinkie pie.
rainbow pinkie, this is my griffon friend, gilda.
rainbow she's half-eagle, half-lion.
rainbow gilda's my best friend from my days at junior speedster flight camp. hey, remember the chant?
rainbow sooo...
rainbow yeah, uh, well, pinkie pie, you don't mind, do you? gilda just got here. we'll catch up with you later.
rainbow yeah, only faster. so now what?
rainbow huh?
rainbow pinkie pie, you are so random.
rainbow a race? you are so on.
rainbow i win.
rainbow no way.
rainbow oh, ome on, i was way ahead of you.
rainbow oh geez, dream on.
rainbow there is no way you beat me.
rainbow hah, see? good thing pinkie pie's here to keep you honest, g.
rainbow new moves? heh, sit back g, this is gonna take a while.
rainbow try matching that. hey, where's pinkie pie and her crazy contraption?
rainbow ugh, i gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. shouldn't take long. just, uh, hang out in town and i'll come find ya.
rainbow later.
rainbow oh pinkie pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. you are a scream.
rainbow come on g, i'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
rainbow g, the punch.
rainbow ha. priceless. priceless. 
rainbow hey g, look, presents.
rainbow hey g, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
rainbow come on then, let's have some cake.
rainbow you know gilda, i was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
rainbow so i guess i'm queen lame-o.
rainbow they weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
rainbow and you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. you know, this is not how i thought my old friends would treat my new friends. if being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
rainbow not cool.
rainbow i'm sorry everypony, for bringing gilda here. i didn't know how rude she was. and pinkie pie, i'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
rainbow i'd rather hang out with you. no hard feelings?
rainbow especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.  eh, i mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. boo!
rainbow so, "great and powerful trixie". what makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
rainbow there's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
rainbow that's my job!
rainbow [electric guitar music]
rainbow they don't call me "rainbow" and "dash" for nothin'!
rainbow whoa! whoa! whoa-a-a-a!  i think i'm  gonna be sick.
rainbow ow!
rainbow yeah! a unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
rainbow it's fine.
rainbow unbelievable!
rainbow hate you?
rainbow whoa, whoa, whoa. magic's got nothing to do with it. trixie's just a loudmouth.
rainbow and after whuppin' that ursa's hind quarters, we're even prouder.
rainbow uh-huh.
rainbow why that little...
rainbow don't be such a scaredy-pony. it's just me, future equestria ball-bouncing record holder. three forty six, three forty seven...
rainbow three hundred fifty four...
rainbow three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
rainbow pinkie pie! now i have to start over.
rainbow huh?
rainbow i'll tell you what we're meant to do. give him the boot. take that. and that!
rainbow okay, girls, you heard her. the fate of equestria is in our hooves. do we have what it takes?
rainbow raaah!
rainbow you bet it is. the higher you go, the chillier it gets.
rainbow heh, oh yeah. that'll keep you nice and cozy.
rainbow are you sure you want fluttershy to come along? i mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. she's just going to slow us down.
rainbow whoa. what was that?
rainbow well, it is a mountain. i'm going to fly up there and check it out! wah!
rainbow oh, all right.
rainbow hey! what are you waiting for? an invitation?
rainbow well, it is a cliff. you could just, oh, i don't know, fly up here?
rainbow augh.
rainbow around the mountain? that's going to take them forever.
rainbow told you it was going to take them forever.
rainbow ugh.
rainbow uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
rainbow not your fault.
rainbow still think it was a good idea to bring fluttershy along?
rainbow mm-hmm.
rainbow oh, great. she's scared of caves now, too.
rainbow oh come on! we've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
rainbow augh.
rainbow i'm not!
rainbow so much for  persuading him.
rainbow all right, that's it. we tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is pinkie pie does.
rainbow it's time to stop wasting time! i'm going in!
rainbow get! out! 
rainbow heh. sorry.
rainbow who-o-o-o-o-a!
rainbow three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
rainbow dragon!
rainbow [goat bleat]
rainbow why are you laughing? that awful dragon is back!
rainbow pinkie pie, you scared me! i mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.
rainbow sinister.
rainbow and the clouds move...
rainbow all on their own!
rainbow here we go. ...
rainbow well... once a month, she comes into ponyville.
rainbow w..what about digging at the ground? you've got to admit that's weird.
rainbow and zecora's still out there.
rainbow yeah, back at ya, zecora! you and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
rainbow well, that's interesting to hear coming from miss magic pants herself.
rainbow yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
rainbow ow!  oh! she's  trying to say-ow!- zecora -oh!- she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!
rainbow i think we'll find a cure to this curse at zecora's place!
rainbow i don't care what you say, twilight. it's time to pony up and confront zecora. come on, girls. are you with me?
rainbow how about you, applejack? applejack?
rainbow rarity's hair!
rainbow i bet they went after zecora.
rainbow hey, a little help here?
rainbow ow!
rainbow hey, wait for me! [screaming and owing]
rainbow ex-cuse me?
rainbow what the...
rainbow aaah!
rainbow ahh!
rainbow you put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
rainbow ok, fine. but what about the cauldron?
rainbow ugh, i caaan't, i need to flyyy. this is waaay too boring for me.
rainbow ugh, sooo boooring.
rainbow what's that sound, twilight?
rainbow wow, what are they?
rainbow uh, i'll take one.
rainbow [baby noises]
rainbow huh? huh?!    get off me!   waaa!
rainbow ditto!
rainbow guh.
rainbow yeah! we can drive 'em back into the forest.
rainbow aye aye.
rainbow pinkie pie, you are so random.
rainbow alright. 
rainbow we call in the weather patrol. 
rainbow time to take out the adorable trash. yaaaaaa!
rainbow whoa. yaa! yow! woah! wow! i can't hold it! she's breaking up.
rainbow heh. hey, it worked. they're not eating the food anymore.
rainbow yeeeaaaa!
rainbow they're not that adorable.
rainbow some sort of infestation.
rainbow three months of winter coolness
rainbow and awesome holidays
rainbow âis here!
rainbow bringing home the southern birds
rainbow a pegasus' job begins
rainbow and clearing all the gloomy skies
rainbow to let the sunshine in
rainbow we move the clouds
rainbow and we melt the white snow
rainbow when the sun comes up
rainbow its warmth and beauty will glow!
rainbow alright team, you're clear for takeoff.
rainbow oh, hey twilight, what's up?
rainbow sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
rainbow um...
rainbow sorry twilight.
rainbow got it.
rainbow got it.
rainbow okay.
rainbow ugh! make up your minds!
rainbow chillax applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
rainbow oh that featherbrain. didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
rainbow [ponies grumble and complain]
rainbow wow, looks like some pony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. let me do something about that. what's the matter, kid?
rainbow cutie mark? i can get you a cutie mark like that! 
rainbow why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
rainbow hey, who are you gonna listen to, applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? i always liked flying an' all, but i was going nowhere in a hurry. it wasn't until my very first race that i discovered a serious need for speed, and kazaam, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.
rainbow that's right, stretch out those legs. gotta be nice and loose. the key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. one of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. are you ready?
rainbow i said: are! you! ready!
rainbow juggling, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow hang-gliding, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow karate, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow kite-flying, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow ultrapony roller derby, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow [>roller ponies
rainbow ]
rainbow tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
rainbow tried that one... tried that one...
rainbow eating cupcakes?
rainbow woo-hoo!
rainbow oh yeah? think you can do better, cowgirl?
rainbow heh! looks like this pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. the object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
rainbow yeah, yeah. i still have the closest throw, applesmack. just try and beat it.
rainbow i lost.
rainbow i hate losing.
rainbow all right, applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of ponyville?
rainbow ...and i think i'm the top athlete. so let's prove it.
rainbow i challenge you to an iron pony competition. a series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
rainbow iron pony competition.
rainbow the most athletic pony ever! 
rainbow i don' know. why is she here?
rainbow right, heh. somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books. 
rainbow thanks, but i  couldn't have been as fast as you.
rainbow oh, i can't believe i won.
rainbow ugh.
rainbow ready for another pony ride?
rainbow does this count?
rainbow yuh
rainbow [ponies cheer]
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow yeah.
rainbow [ponies gasp]
rainbow fluttershy: 
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow yes!
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow [hens clucking]
rainbow [chicks chirping]
rainbow huh?
rainbow i can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
rainbow woo-hoo! i win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case.  i am the iron pony!
rainbow what?
rainbow sounds like sour apples to me.
rainbow well... no. but you never said i couldn't use my wings.
rainbow i still would have won even without my wings.
rainbow gladly. how?
rainbow heh! easy shmeasy.
rainbow no wings? no problem.
rainbow [blows raspberry]
rainbow pardon me, excuse me. make way for the iron pony.
rainbow so, applejack, you ready to win second place?
rainbow yeah, yeah...
rainbow i could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
rainbow very funny.
rainbow good one, twilight.
rainbow what? you're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.
rainbow egghead.
rainbow and you know this from...
rainbow what'd you read, "the egghead's guide to running"? did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?  get it? eye muscles.
rainbow yeah. see you at the finish line... tomorrow.
rainbow come on, rainbow. show 'em a little dash.
rainbow you didn't think i was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
rainbow not so fast, applejack! this race isn't over yet!
rainbow whoa! guh, i don't believe it, applejack tripped me.
rainbow oh, i see. a big cheater is what i see.
rainbow sure it was. i mean, yeah, i'm sure it was.
rainbow yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.
rainbow look, ma, no wings.
rainbow [blows raspberry]
rainbow nice one, rainbow.
rainbow aaa!
rainbow i'm sure i'll win now.
rainbow oh horse apples... see ya!
rainbow what the hay?! you said no flying!
rainbow aaa!
rainbow whoa!
rainbow you know, i think twilight's right.
rainbow yeah! if you wanna beat me, you better... ruuun!
rainbow no, you cut it out!
rainbow and now i'm gonna finish it.
rainbow oh yes, i will.  that's it! all bets are off!
rainbow i won!
rainbow i won!
rainbow tied?!
rainbow then who won?
rainbow you?
rainbow you ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
rainbow i don't believe it. twilight beat us.
rainbow we weren't very good sports.
rainbow princess celestia?!
rainbow i'd love to stretch my legs.
rainbow look out below!
rainbow sorry. new trick. didn't quite work.
rainbow outfit for the what now?
rainbow oh, i love fun things!
rainbow yeah, they're...
rainbow mine's just not as cool as i was imagining. she asked.
rainbow what?
rainbow no, i just want my dress to be cool.
rainbow the color's fine, just make it look cooler.
rainbow the shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. it needs to be about 20% cooler.
rainbow all we really like is what we know
rainbow it's cool!
rainbow that's so cool!
rainbow you think we overdid it?
rainbow she kind of is.
rainbow that's your answer for everything!
rainbow well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
rainbow you worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. we all saw how well that turned out.
rainbow now, what have we learned?
rainbow good.
rainbow yes, and most importantly?
rainbow right! so now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
rainbow ... ugh. you're gonna cheer for me like that? louder.
rainbow louder!
rainbow louder!
rainbow ugh...
rainbow [deep breath] and now, phase one of my routine.
rainbow phase two.
rainbow here we go. phase three. the sonic rainboom. c'mon!  uh-oh. 
rainbow hehe. sorry about that ladies. that was a truly feeble performance.
rainbow ugh. i'm not talking about my performance, i'm talking about yours. that feeble cheering!
rainbow i wish you guys could come to cloudsdale to see me compete in the best young flyer competition.
rainbow yeah. i wish you guys could be there. fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
rainbow it was a long time ago... i was just a filly.
rainbow are... you kidding? i'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of cloudsdale! i could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
rainbow the grand prize is an entire day with the wonderbolts. a whole day of flying with my life-long heroes... it'll be a dream come true!
rainbow i'm gonna go rest up. don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. hehe. you, on the other hand, better keep practicing. i need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
rainbow you've got to learn to be assertive, fluttershy. don't be afraid to speak up.
rainbow i didn't get kicked out.
rainbow those guys are right. i'll never be able to do it.
rainbow aaaaaah! what do i do?! every pony's gonna see me fail! the wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. princess celestia will probably banish me to the everfree forest! my life is ruined!
rainbow rare?! the sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
rainbow rarity! are you... flying?!
rainbow we?.. i... i can't believe it!
rainbow this is so cool! you guys made it!
rainbow wait!.. how'd you do that? only pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
rainbow to be honest, i was starting to get just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. but i feel a lot better now that you guys are here.
rainbow hey, we've got some time before the competition. why don't fluttershy and i show you around cloudsdale?
rainbow here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
rainbow uhh... some of the greatest pegasi in history came from cloudsdale!
rainbow great idea! c'mon girls. to the weather factory!
rainbow this is where they make the snowflakes. each one is hoofmade. as you can see, it's a delicate operation.
rainbow we better move on before rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
rainbow and here's where they make the rainbows!
rainbow yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
rainbow rarity! what're you doing talking to these guys?
rainbow oohh...
rainbow are you kidding? i can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. i'm doomed!
rainbow [group of workers awing at rarity]
rainbow of course! why wouldn't i be ok? everyone's so in love with rarity's wings that they won't even notice when i totally blow it in the best young flyer's competition.
rainbow what?!
rainbow [workers continue awing at rarity]
rainbow what am i gonna do?! i'll never win the competition now...
rainbow [crowd cheering]
rainbow eyah!
rainbow umm...
rainbow she's talking to you!
rainbow uhh... what am i gonna do?
rainbow [scared babble]
rainbow c'mon rainbow dash. you can do this. just remember the routine. phase one.
rainbow [crowd cheering]

rainbow come on!
rainbow twilight!
rainbow that could take forever! there's gotta be way to narrow it down.
rainbow she must be in there. let's go!
rainbow heh. i can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
rainbow uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
rainbow ghk...
rainbow awwww!
rainbow psst! pinkie pie, you asleep yet?
rainbow if i was sleeping, how could i have asked you if you were asleep?
rainbow when we get to appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?
rainbow [whispering and sarcasm] ... no, fluttershy.
rainbow i do not think she's a tree! i was just â
rainbow no. well.. yes. but not exactly â
rainbow hmm.. something tells me this isn't a circus act.
rainbow hey there!
rainbow where ya headed in such a hurry?
rainbow wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky... no offense.
rainbow i just wanna know â hey!
rainbow i'm talking to you â whoa...

rainbow ugggh..
rainbow dragon-napping spike. i'll show her! ow...
rainbow ooh, i can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... hnnh... ow! nobody tricks rainbow dash and gets away with it.
rainbow yah! â¦ pinkie pie!
rainbow shhshh! what do you think you're doing?! you gotta get out of here!
rainbow you're gonna blow my cover.
rainbow i'm trying to save spike!
rainbow and the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught.
rainbow run, pinkie, i'll hold 'em off. save yourself!
rainbow ugh...
rainbow huh.. well, i still don't trust them. i say we turn tail and bail while we still â
rainbow you!
rainbow that's it! we are outta here!
rainbow yeah, right.
rainbow huh?
rainbow hmph...
rainbow huh-ah.. i'll say they had a good reason! c'mon. we have some apple-pickin' appleloosians to talk to!
rainbow we promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
rainbow we brought our new pal, little strongheart here, to explain to the appleloosians why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
rainbow the land is theirs! you planted the trees not knowing that. honest mistake. now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
rainbow plant the trees somewhere else!
rainbow the buffalo had it first!
rainbow come on applejack!
rainbow [at the same time] >applejack
rainbow you're bein' unreasonable! >rainbow dash
rainbow i put my hoof down!
rainbow i know you don't want to do this.
rainbow i don't know... but it's never too late to think of something.
rainbow come on, think. think, think, think, think, think, think, think!
rainbow he's not gonna do it!
rainbow [pinkie pie]
rainbow âwhaddaya say?
rainbow you got to share
rainbow you got to care
rainbow it's the right thing to do
rainbow so... what do i have to do to get to be one of the princess's royal guards, anyway?  is the pay good?  hellooo! anybody home?
rainbow ooh, you're good.  too good. i'm bored.
rainbow what are you two doing? are you having a race? oh, can i play? 1 2 3 go!
rainbow [indistinct whispers] hey, you know what you should do? you should go over there and tickle them!
rainbow [royal guards laugh]
rainbow yeah!
rainbow [everypony laughs]
rainbow <a href="/wiki/credits" title="credits">credits</a>
rainbow i hear you're looking for my cutie mark story?
rainbow it all happened during the race at flight camp, where i stood alone against all odds to defend fluttershy's honor. i've never flown like that before. that freedom was unlike anything i've ever felt. the speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... i liked it a lot.
rainbow turns out the only thing i liked more than flying fast... was winning! most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tail. but that day... the day i discovered racing... i proved that the legends were true. i made the impossible happen!
rainbow and that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
rainbow wow, twilight! you're lucky to have such a rad assistant. i wish i had someone to do whatever i told them.
rainbow oh yeah, pipsqueak? how about taking out the trash?
rainbow he's probably just jealous of owlowiscious.
rainbow nice one! now, let me show you how itâs really done.
rainbow hey, pinkie pie!
rainbow me neither. when pinkie pie throws a party, i am there! ta-da!
rainbow what kind of surprises?
rainbow see ya later, birthday alligator!
rainbow this afternoon?
rainbow oh, man! weâd love to, butâ¦ weâreâ¦ house-sitting this afternoon.
rainbow uh, look at the time! weâd really better get going.
rainbow harry.
rainbow yeah, i donât think you know him.
rainbow yup! heâs a bear all right, and heâll be pretty upset if we donât get over to his house soon.
rainbow but heâs fixed up the place so much it feels like a house.
rainbow a-at the beach!
rainbow yup! he loves to...
rainbow [over fluttershy] play beach volleyball! ...collect sea shells! ...play sea shells!
rainbow gotta go!
rainbow hi, pinkie pie! uh-oh!
rainbow phewâ¦
rainbow ah!
rainbow applejack! we have a problem!
rainbow you heard her! construction!
rainbow [ponies mimicking noises of various construction tools]
rainbow hey there, pinkie pie! sorry i was in such a rush earlier. had some place to be and couldnât slow down and say, âhello.â you know how it goes.
rainbow yeahâ¦ so, why donât you come with me over to sweet apple acres?
rainbow uhâ¦ pinkie pie?
rainbow aaallrighty. what do you say we get out of creepytown and head over to applejackâsâ¦
rainbow you should really just come with me.
rainbow who you calling a chump, chump?! ughâ¦ thatâs it. partyâs over. come on, pinkie pie!
rainbow pinkie pie, letâs go!
rainbow youâ¦  have toâ¦ come withâ¦ me!
rainbow oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! weâll do this the hard way!
rainbow we're... here...
rainbow uh, yeah! because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
rainbow uh-huh! it sure would.
rainbow iâm just glad i havenât been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
rainbow you donât wanna know.
rainbow for gummy, yeah!
rainbow for what?
rainbow sure thing, spike.
rainbow uh... i-i don't know, spike.
rainbow been dreaming, i've been waiting
rainbow to fly with those brave ponies
rainbow the wonderbolts, their daring tricks
rainbow spinning 'round and having kicks
rainbow perform for crowds of thousands
rainbow they'll shower us with diamonds
rainbow the wonderbolts will see me right here at the gala!
rainbow as a wonderbolt is
rainbow to prove!
rainbow hey, no prob.
rainbow hay yeah! name's rainbow dash.
rainbow sure. why not? i'm... hanging... with the... wonderbolts! [squee, giggle]
rainbow hey, spitfire! you ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to soarin'] you ever soared past lightning? it's awesome!
rainbow this isn't hanging out.
rainbow if it's the last thing i do...
rainbow come on, rainbow! if they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.
rainbow this is my chance! yes! whoa!
rainbow yeah! hanging out with friends!
rainbow come back here you! gotcha! eww, what is this?... cotton candy? wait a second! it's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. you can't justâ you did. hey, i didn't tell you to go anywhere!
rainbow there's crazy weather all over equestria! cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! but don't worry. i'm not leaving you until i get control of ponyville!
rainbow all right, princess!
rainbow hey! nopony insults the princess!
rainbow that's right! i'll always be loyal to the princess!
rainbow nope! dopey discord forgot about these babies! i'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the elements in no time. my wings!
rainbow the first rule?
rainbow yeah! like twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
rainbow moving out!
rainbow i've got you now, element.
rainbow get off there and put 'em up! come on! let's go!
rainbow i've got a message for you, too!
rainbow cloudsdale? crumble... without me? no!
rainbow hey guys!
rainbow that's nice.
rainbow pfft. loyalty, schmoyalty! have you guys seen ponyville? it's a disaster! i'm staying here in cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
rainbow nice try! ponyville's your problem, not mine.
rainbow lemme go! i don't need you guys! leave me alone!
rainbow wh-what happened?  how's ponyville? where are the elements?! did we stop discord?
rainbow [assorted grunting and hi-yah noises]
rainbow uh, what are you talking about?
rainbow i don't have any issues with applejack.
rainbow ...because she asked me to. right applejack?
rainbow you got it, boss.
rainbow [various shock statements]
rainbow yes?
rainbow yes?
rainbow yes?
rainbow [sighs of relief]
rainbow canterlot?
rainbow wait!
rainbow ...but we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
rainbow mmhmm.
rainbow [all right, etc]
rainbow even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
rainbow [laughing maniacally]
rainbow lighten up, old-timer. it's the best night of the year for pranks!
rainbow it's all in good fun. oh oh, there's another group over there!
rainbow haha! woohoo! yeah!  woah!
rainbow who? oh, it's you, owlowiscious. c'mon, try and keep up! 
rainbow winona? i mean... winona's head?! um, is this weird, or is it just me? angel? gummy?! okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
rainbow whaa!
rainbow phew.
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow what are you all doing out here?
rainbow uh, you do?
rainbow oh, i'm not mad. you all are right. not much point of a pony pet playdate for me if i'm a pony without a pet, right?
rainbow hey, now wait a minute! just because i don't have a pet now doesn't mean i never want a pet!
rainbow i can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules
rainbow it's of utmost importance
rainbow the pet that i get
rainbow is something that's awesome and cool
rainbow i need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
rainbow cutesy, wootsie? have you even met me?
rainbow sky is good. i'd like it to fly.
rainbow pass.
rainbow otters and seals do not fly.
rainbow that's it. i'm outta here.
rainbow bigger. and cooler.
rainbow it's just a squirrel.
rainbow ...yeah. so, like i was saying...
rainbow fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it
rainbow i need a pet to keep up with me
rainbow something awesome, something flying
rainbow with coolness that defies gravity!
rainbow ya think?
rainbow better, but cooler.
rainbow now you're talking. but instead of just one standout, now that's too many.
rainbow so many choices, and such riches aplenty
rainbow the bat would be awesome, but the wasp i'm digging too
rainbow do you have something in a yellow striped bat?
rainbow what to do, what to do? 
rainbow a prize! that's it! there's really just one way
rainbow to find out which animal's best
rainbow hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts
rainbow that will put each pet to the test
rainbow then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
rainbow just like me
rainbow can't settle for less, 'cause i'm the best
rainbow so a contest we will see
rainbow who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet
rainbow in the world for me
rainbow begin
rainbow and may the best pet win!
rainbow [blows whistle]
rainbow [whistle blow] shh! [to assembled animals] so! you all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? well, we'll just see about that! if any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. this competition isn't for the weak. you'd better be prepared to step up your game! you call that flapping?! that's better. there's only room on team dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! any questions?
rainbow seriously, fluttershy! the turtle? what did you bring that thing here for?
rainbow no.
rainbow ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. look at him!
rainbow but--
rainbow grrgh, fine! but don't say i didn't warn you! this isn't a game, you know! alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities i'm looking for in a pet. speed, agility, guts, style. coolness. awesomeness. and radicalness.
rainbow you would think that, twilight. and that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
rainbow speed! on your marks...
rainbow get set... [blows whistle] sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
rainbow yeah! that's speed!
rainbow [to the tortoise] that's just sad.
rainbow agility! sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] wanna know the opposite of agility? that.
rainbow yeah baby, now that's what i call agility! don't leave me hangin'! i'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
rainbow okay! which of you has the guts to try and get opal's favorite toy away from her?
rainbow now that takes guts!
rainbow style! any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
rainbow coolness!
rainbow [owl hoots]
rainbow sorta cool.
rainbow [duck quacks]
rainbow not cool.
rainbow [bat cries]
rainbow pretty cool.
rainbow [toucan cries]
rainbow could be cooler.
rainbow [wasp buzzing]
rainbow not what i had in mind. i can't hear you!
rainbow [tortoise coughs]
rainbow eugh.
rainbow [eagle cries]
rainbow now that's a cool sound!
rainbow [to bat] sorta awesome. [to toucan] not awesome. [to flamingo] could be more awesome. [to owl] hohoho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] uh, you did that already. that's pretty much all you can do, huh?
rainbow [bat plays theme song, squeals and glasses shatter]
rainbow whoa! that was truly awesome! but... i'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so i'm gonna have to take some points off.  listen, turtle...
rainbow whatever! you've had your fun, but i think you and i both know who made the cut and who didn't.
rainbow [turtle croaks]
rainbow you didn't.
rainbow i mean... a for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe i've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. you're starting to creep me out. so, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. so the final, tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect ...a race against me! through ghastly gorge! dun dun dun!
rainbow [eagle cries]
rainbow gesundheit.
rainbow ["ride of the valkyries" plays]
rainbow actually, ghastly gorge isn't scary. it's fun. heh. i've flown through it a million times myself, so, obviously i'll be at the front of the pack. but whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor, and glory, of getting to be my pet! ready? setgo!
rainbow woohoo! haha! try to keep up!
rainbow can't catch me, ha ha!
rainbow c'mon, slowpokes! you wanna win, don't ya?
rainbow oh! i forgot to tell you! watch out for the quarray eels! they don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. whoa.
rainbow easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! right guys?
rainbow avalanche! hey! whoaaaa!
rainbow c'mon... no! wait! come back! don't leave me! i'm the one who's supposed to win! i don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. forever is way too long to be trapped in ghastly gorge. i mean, it's like, forever! somepony! anypony! help me!
rainbow wahoo! my prayers have been answered! oh, thankyouthankyoutha- you?! oh no! now i'm not only going to be stuck here forever, i'm gonna be stuck here with the most annoying turtle in the world! gyh, i'm doomed. doomed, i tell you!
rainbow just my pride.
rainbow uh... thanks. what you did... i owe you one.
rainbow oh... right... yeah. that.
rainbow easy, fella. nothing to be afraid of. the falcon sure does looks cool... he's absolutely everything i wanted in a pet. 
rainbow but i said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
rainbow and the only racer who crossed the finish line with me, was the one who stopped to save me when i needed help. the tortoise!
rainbow [falcon cry]
rainbow spike, take a letter. dear princess celestia, i used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. but now i can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.
rainbow today i learned what the most important quality really is. a certain kind of spirit. a stick-to-it-ive-ness. a never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. and this tortoise has it.
rainbow gesundheit. you just can't stop that little guy. he's like a... like a... tank!
rainbow hmm...
rainbow heh. c'mon, tank! we're gonna be late for our very first pony pet playdate!
rainbow [ponies chattering]
rainbow what about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
rainbow [ponies agreeing]
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow what a beautiful day. there's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a pegasus feel super relaxed.
rainbow looks like my sky swim will have to wait! i'm rainbow dash, and i'm here to rescue you!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow wow. what's with this crowd? uh, thanks everypony. it was really no big deal.
rainbow oh no! there's something wrong with the baby!
rainbow [crowd gasps]
rainbow she's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, rainbow dash!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow [cameras clicking]
rainbow never fear, your friendly neighborhood rainbow dash is here!
rainbow [old ponies screaming]
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow i can't hear you!
rainbow and then, i zoomed into the well. i knew it would be dark and dangerous, but i didn't let that stop me. danger's my middle name. rainbow 'danger' dash. thinking back on it, i acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
rainbow hey, applejack. how'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
rainbow maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. but i'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. that's why i hired spike as my ghost writer.
rainbow ...anyway. spike here writes down everything i say. don't you, spike?
rainbow this way, i can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. yep, it takes guts. but it also takes brains. and sometimes a big lunch and a nap. being a hero is surely not for everypony, but i'm up to the challenge.
rainbow there you go.
rainbow aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
rainbow yeah, yeah. i've got a good ten seconds to spare. just a couple more.
rainbow mare do well, huh? well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
rainbow [ponies screaming]
rainbow [clears throat] never fear, your friendly neighborhood rainbow-
rainbow ugh, fine! picky, picky. whoaaaa!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow i can't believe it. mare do well is stronger than me? well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
rainbow [jackhammer and drills]
rainbow huh? never fear, your friendly neighbor- whoa!
rainbow [building creaking]
rainbow never fear-uh-i'm coming- hold on- whoa!
rainbow here ya go, safe and sound.
rainbow well, mare do well, or should i call you mare-do-slow? you're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause i move like lightning.
rainbow okay. she's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. i've gotta step up my game.
rainbow [water rushing]
rainbow if the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! looks like ponyville needs a hero! easy peasy.
rainbow [stone cracking]
rainbow my game is officially back on. if only somepony were here to pat me on the back. eh, guess i'll have do it myself-   help!  help! you?! i suppose you want me to thank- you gotta be kidding me...
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow lemme get this straight. she's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? ughhh! how do i compete with that? wait a minute. i do have a leg up on her. and that leg is... wings! hah! take that, mare do well!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow oh, for the love of pete.
rainbow i don't have to admire that! i don't think she's all that great!
rainbow i didn't say that.
rainbow who, me?
rainbow don't write that, spike!
rainbow [others laughing]
rainbow fine! laugh all you want, but i'll be the one laughing when i prove to you all that i'm just as good- no, that i'm a better hero than mare do well!
rainbow huh, no sign of trouble here, darnit.
rainbow buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
rainbow rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! how am i supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?  hold it right there, granny smith! you don't have to pretend with me. i can see that you're in way over your head here.
rainbow you're putting on a brave face, i get it. but you don't have to anymore. i'll help you cross the street!
rainbow don't worry! you're in extremely... capable... hooves!
rainbow here we are! safe and sound. a good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
rainbow somepony's in trouble!
rainbow you'd better let me open this, ma'am! for your own safety, i must ask you to stand back!
rainbow [clicks neck] 
rainbow ta-da!
rainbow how would you describe what i just did? would you say i was amazing?
rainbow please, just answer the question! was i, or was i not, amazing?
rainbow oh look!
rainbow [lawnmower rattling]
rainbow another great feat of heroism! i have just saved that grass!
rainbow from weeds! weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
rainbow aww, who am i kidding?
rainbow [thundercloud rumbles throughout]
rainbow all anypony talks about is mare do well this, and mare do well that! what about me? how could everypony forget about me so easily? i mean... have i changed? same sleek body. same flowing mane. same spectacular hooves. nope, i'm still awesome. they're wrong. but... then... why am i all alone? i hate being all alone.
rainbow i knew it! no need to apologize, squirt. anypony could make that mistake.
rainbow wait a minute. why are you here?
rainbow no! no way! can't you see i- i wanna be alone? i love being alone.
rainbow yeah, right, like i'm gonna thank her.  thank you, mare do well, whoever you are, for ruining e-  hey squirt! wait up!
rainbow the mysterious mare do well, huh?
rainbow [ponies gasp]
rainbow so what are you hiding? let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
rainbow what the hay?
rainbow grrr... i got you now! alright, miss mysterious! mystery... solved!  p-p-p-p- pinkie?! whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! twilight?! applejack?! there were three of you?
rainbow i don't understand. why? don't you want me to be a hero?
rainbow uh, i guess i did start to brag a little.
rainbow okay, a lot.
rainbow ohhhh. that makes loads more sense. yeah. you're right. and i guess i should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. like mare do well.
rainbow that's nice of you, spike, but i really wanna write this letter myself.
rainbow okay, let's hear it.
rainbow look out! it's a real ghost!
rainbow how about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
rainbow uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
rainbow duh, the one in your mouth!
rainbow hey, wait up! we're your friends! i'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! c'mon you guys! let's show them how to party ponyville style!
rainbow don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
rainbow huh?  don't tell me! you-you tied yourselves up?
rainbow sounded like fluttershy to me!
rainbow that sounded like pinkie pie!
rainbow put her down, right now!
rainbow i mean it, dragon boy!
rainbow drop her, scaly!
rainbow look! the wonderbolts!
rainbow on it!
rainbow [wind rushing]
rainbow all in a day's work.
rainbow i can hardly wait!
rainbow yeah, i wish it was hearth's warming eve every day.
rainbow i spy a snowpony!
rainbow aaah, rain-bow-dash! rain-bow-dash! aaaah! thank you, thank you!
rainbow well it should be the 'rainbow dash show'! i'm the star!
rainbow all i wanna know is why the earth ponies are hogging all the food!?
rainbow for the hundredth time, it's not us! we're not making it snow! it must be the unicorns! they're doing it with their freaky magic!
rainbow what a shocker. an earth pony with no ideas.
rainbow you're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!
rainbow well, i'm leaving first!
rainbow atten-tion! well? aren't you curious about how it went?
rainbow horribly! those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? we have got to break ranks with those weak foals!
rainbow we must find a new land!
rainbow c'mon, private pansy, let's get a move on! hup-one, hup-two!
rainbow [lightning cracks]
rainbow get a hold of yourself, private! we cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. to find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!
rainbow you never know where enemies might be lurking.
rainbow a-ha! what's that?! [fighting noises]
rainbow okay. this is getting old.
rainbow this is the new land we've been searching for!
rainbow i proclaim this new land to be... pegasopolis!
rainbow we found our new home!
rainbow i planted my flag first!
rainbow did too!
rainbow the name is pegasopolis!
rainbow pegasopolis!
rainbow i say we fight for the land. may the best pony win!
rainbow [wind blows]
rainbow i'll have you court-martialled for insubordination, private! we settle this on the battlefield!
rainbow oh no. not again.
rainbow [wind blowing]
rainbow it's commander hurricane.
rainbow you mean like this, your highness?
rainbow private? outline our territory for everypony to see. see this real, non-invisible line? no unicorns or earth ponies are allowed to cross it! this is the sovereign territory of pegasopolis!
rainbow what are you doing? don't go around the rock, go over it! i'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!
rainbow i claim this rock for pegasopolis!
rainbow hey! you invaded our territory!
rainbow that's the last straw!
rainbow [arguing over rock]
rainbow great. now there's no way out! we're trapped!
rainbow you've been fighting too, your highness.
rainbow that's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! earth ponies are numbskulls!
rainbow why do i always have to do all the high up chores? why can't twilight use her magic for a change!
rainbow y'know what? i got it.
rainbow aw yeah, heh, just you wait! once little pound cake gets there his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
rainbow i got tickets to the wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. gotta dash!
rainbow huh? now, <span title="&quot;be careful&quot; in the updated itunes rerelease and just &quot;careful&quot; on subsequent television airings" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">careful, derpy</span>! don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
rainbow yeah. it's a mystery.
rainbow no! nothing! in the name of celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
rainbow [wood splintering]
rainbow seeya in a week!
rainbow well, that is the point.
rainbow what do you mean applejack's not coming back?! she loves ponyville!
rainbow so, what are we waiting for? let's go find her!
rainbow i hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. i don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
rainbow why didn't you come back to ponyville?!
rainbow âchange of sceneryâ? what's that supposed to mean?
rainbow excuse me, aj, but we didn't travel all over equestria searching for you to come home without you!
rainbow twilight's right. we gotta get her to spill the beans.
rainbow fine! why don't you quit talking and get walking?
rainbow [gears turning]
rainbow really? did you see wild bull hickok? what about calamity mane?
rainbow did you tell her why you weren't going back?
rainbow is it because i made it rain on you that one time?
rainbow that's 'cause we're playing too nice.
rainbow it's time to call in the big guns.
rainbow [five thumps]
rainbow the only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans.
rainbow tomorrow, huh? i don't know...
rainbow yeah, maybe.
rainbow pull over!
rainbow come on, fluttershy!
rainbow no time! they knew what they were getting into!
rainbow not so fast!
rainbow but the telegram said you were gonna send money.
rainbow and we're your friends! we don't care if you came in fiftieth place! you're still number one in our books.
rainbow nn-nn.
rainbow darn it! now you got me acting all sappy!
rainbow c'mon, fluttershy! cider season's about to start!
rainbow the rush? don't you remember what happened last year? or the year before that? or pretty much any cider season ever?
rainbow pinkie pie. she always ends up ahead of us in line and then they always run out of cider!
rainbow well not this year! this year i'm gonna get there before sunrise, so i can drink all the cider i want, and laugh when she doesn't get any! it's the perfect plan. y'know, i might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her- 
rainbow who are all these ponies?!
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow surprise surprise. you ran out again!
rainbow why can't you make enough cider for all of us? or at least for me!
rainbow [motorized noises]
rainbow i doubt that.
rainbow oh for pete's sake!
rainbow is this some kind of cruel joke?
rainbow who cares how good the cider is if i never get to drink any?
rainbow in my sleep!
rainbow we don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
rainbow applejack, help me!
rainbow all right then, double time!
rainbow i ought to press you into jerk cider!
rainbow awwww.
rainbow huh, how long do i need to lie here? i've got things i need to do!
rainbow you guys have gotta get me out of here, i'm gonna climb the walls!
rainbow few days? might as well be a few months, or few years!
rainbow what's this? 'daring do and the quest for the sapphire stone'.
rainbow no thanks. i so don't read. i'm a world-class athlete. reading's for eggheads like you, twilight. heh, no offense, but i am not reading. it's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
rainbow ...to get to the other side! get it? nevermind...
rainbow [clock ticking]
rainbow [growls in frustration] 
rainbow [dash's head banging on bed]
rainbow as daring do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. if only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. but her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years! huh. i'm right there with you, sister.
rainbow the mosquitoes buzzed loudly. the macaws cried from the high trees. yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step.
rainbow [various big cats growling and roaring]
rainbow [kitten mewing]
rainbow [steadily getting more excited] safely landing on the other side, daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. she turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!
rainbow i hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... i love this story! i, i- i love reading! i'm an egghead.
rainbow the smell of decay and danger hit daring do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple.
rainbow [beetles scuttling]
rainbow [various noises: metal hitting stone, fire whooshing, alligators snapping, shing, etc]
rainbow uh, hey, guys...
rainbow [short nervous laugh] no no, you first.
rainbow aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. go again!
rainbow whoaa, you found my seagull.
rainbow [seagull crying]
rainbow you zapped my weather pony! uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. oh, my thunderbolt. aw, and that's my last cloud. you found it. guess you guys win, i lose. [makes horse noise]
rainbow you win some, you lose some.
rainbow thanks for coming!
rainbow do? who said anything about daring do? i told you i'm not interested in reading.  it's nap time for me! [mocks snoring]
rainbow daring do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber.
rainbow at last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!
rainbow [stone clinking]
rainbow [arrows firing]
rainbow uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but-
rainbow oh, just in time. i am soo hungry.
rainbow [makes exaggerated eating noises]
rainbow âyou thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, miss do.â
rainbow whoa! who is this dude?
rainbow h- oh, good evening-
rainbow -morning. doc.
rainbow of course not. 
rainbow what? later today? [biting hoof]
rainbow right now?! 'right now' right now?
rainbow but i don't feel better!
rainbow how will i ever find out what happens to daring do?!
rainbow is ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? what's gonna happen to daring?! ah-ha! twilight has a copy of the book! uh, but i can't ask her after i called her an egghead and all... ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
rainbow owww... [grunts in pain unrealistically] oh, the pain... the pain!
rainbow well, uh, my wing! it's still hurtin', doc. oh, ouch! right there.
rainbow uh, right. well, i think that one's hurting now too.
rainbow b-but, you got me all wrong, doc! i'm not being lazy!
rainbow what am i gonna do? i'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to daring do! ...which may not be such a bad thing...
rainbow [owl hoots]
rainbow [heart monitor beeping]
rainbow i'm not trying to steal your slippers, i'm trying to steal this book!
rainbow i'm an egghead.
rainbow see, i was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of-
rainbow you got me.
rainbow good? try awesomely amazing. that book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! but then i had to put it down; i was sent home before i could finish it.
rainbow oh, thanks twilight. i'm sorry i made such a big deal about all of this. i thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
rainbow yeah, i get it. i shouldn't knock something until i've tried it.
rainbow [to spike] didja get all that?
rainbow great! you write the letter, i've gotta finish this book! 
rainbow and so, with ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured...
rainbow ...the world was safe and sound once again, thanks to daring do! [sighs in admiration] daring do and the griffon's goblet... awesome!
rainbow [indistinct chatter]
rainbow [school bell ringing]
rainbow yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
rainbow you got it!
rainbow and my team gave the all clear from fillydelphia to las pegasus.
rainbow hey, twilight, another pegasus just got back from baltimare with an all-clear and-  what's going on? aren't you gonna stop him?
rainbow oh, this is too rich.  hey twilight! there's a mouse right behind you!
rainbow oh no!
rainbow uhhh... i'm not so sure that's a-
rainbow y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
rainbow look, fluttershy, i watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! you owe me!
rainbow yeaagh! ugh!
rainbow okay, i guess i'll let you off the hook this time.
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow shoot! you don't think we missed them, do you?
rainbow pfft, pretty lame move. is that all they've got?
rainbow [dragon roaring]
rainbow uh, not so much. the word 'fierce' comes to mind.
rainbow yeah, right, spike. that's one of the scariest aprons i've ever seen!
rainbow one tough stain against one lame dragon. 
rainbow hey guys!
rainbow ya wanna join us for breakfast?
rainbow what?!?
rainbow spike, that's nonsense talk! i know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! they're big, and tough, and scary...
rainbow all i'm saying is that you could get hurt.
rainbow aaagh!
rainbow don't tell me you think he should go?
rainbow i still say you're nutty, but hey, i've done lots of nutty things.
rainbow [under her breath] rrgh.
rainbow yeah, we hope your trip-
rainbow - your quest answers some of your pesky "who am i?" questions.
rainbow go get 'em, big guy!
rainbow i'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
rainbow we can't worry about that now, twilight. we're here to help spike!
rainbow [strained noise]
rainbow not so fast!
rainbow forever?!
rainbow i should've stopped him back at the library when i had the chance!
rainbow oh no, they took spike! we've gotta go after them!
rainbow i'm sorry, but we gotta help spike!
rainbow nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
rainbow calling all pegasus ponies! meeting tonight!
rainbow library, tonight. be cool, or be mule. no offense.
rainbow alright, go on in, find a seat. ohh... you too, fluttershy. come on, let's go.
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow [old film projector running up]
rainbow [old music begins playing]
rainbow so, here's the scoop. cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of equestria. and you know what that means. it means it's up to ponyville's pegasi to bring that water up to cloudsdale.
rainbow not only that, but spitfire, captain of the wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. now last year, fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. but i think we can do better. i think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
rainbow ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.
rainbow that coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, thunderlane. nopony's getting sick on my watch. so, are we gonna train hard?
rainbow are we gonna be strong?
rainbow are we gonna be fast?
rainbow record-smashing fast?
rainbow who's with me?
rainbow fluttershy!
rainbow stretch those glutes, flitter! nice flexibility, cloudchaser. a... little too much flexibility, blossomforth. uh, somepony give blossomforth a hoof. let's see some faster trotting, thunderlane! good pace, silverspeed! [blows whistle] keep it up! we're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
rainbow good work, everypony! [under her breath] everypony except fluttershy.
rainbow fluttershy? i know you're in there! you're avoiding tornado duty and i want to know why! fluttershy, open-
rainbow fluttershy, what happened to you?
rainbow oh, you poor thing. you know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
rainbow cold water! those pony pox are clearing right up.
rainbow [blows whistle]
rainbow messed up wing, huh? stop horsing around, fluttershy. we've got a lot of training to do. come on now, what's going on?
rainbow what are you talking about? just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
rainbow it wasn't that bad.
rainbow suck it up, fluttershy! this is no time for- i mean, confidence or no confidence, i'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record, including you. i need every ounce of wing power i can get.
rainbow thanks anyway.
rainbow you will?
rainbow you're game?
rainbow alright!
rainbow don't worry, twilight. thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, thunderlane?
rainbow not bad...not bad. [joints cracking] [revving sounds]
rainbow now listen up! if each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. we'll be number one!
rainbow impressive. fluttershy, your turn. [blows whistle]
rainbow [hushed, to twilight sparkle] no, you tell her!
rainbow um... great job, fluttershy! you measured, uh, uh, .5.
rainbow fluttershy, wait! so some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. you aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
rainbow but i need you!
rainbow this is crazy awesome! we're gonna smash that record!
rainbow [squirrel chittering]
rainbow you did awesome, fluttershy.
rainbow so you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. every bit counts!
rainbow well, uh... i'd feel... um...
rainbow if only there was a way to lift fluttershy out of the dumps.
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow are we ready to do this?
rainbow lazy thunderlane! where is he?! he's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. rumble, where's your lazy brother?
rainbow don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
rainbow phew!
rainbow no. of course not. forget the record. cloudsdale still needs water! okay, everypony! let's give it all we've got! on the sound of the horn, we take off!
rainbow yaa- oof!
rainbow i'm fine!
rainbow rbbbb- we've got to try again!
rainbow no! one more time! i've gotta know we gave it our all! if i'm going down, i'm going down flying! c'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
rainbow stay in position! flap those wings! faster!
rainbow c'mon! just a little harder! i can see the water trying to funnel through!
rainbow whoa, girl, take it easy!
rainbow yeah, we did it! you did it!
rainbow ah!
rainbow thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, fluttershy! let's hear it for fluttershy!
rainbow you guys!
rainbow the new gabby gums just came out! âthe great and powerful trixie's secrets revealed!â
rainbow did you forget who you're talking to? the day i get a hooficure is the day i turn in my daredevil license. besides, i haven't read this gabby gums yet.
rainbow are you kidding? do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
rainbow it's that good, huh? well, maybe just one little hoof.
rainbow forget it, i don't like ponies touching my hooves. man... i'd love it if gabby gums did a story on me.
rainbow well, my life is officially over. gabby gums has made it to cloudsdale.
rainbow i grabbed as many copies as i could, but it was too late!  i'm a laughing stock!
rainbow well, if it isn't gabby gums.
rainbow are you kidding? everypony in town knows it's you three.
rainbow [rain falling]
rainbow i gotta admit i'm pretty beat.
rainbow so...
rainbow fine! if you want to stand guard, go for it. we're going to bed.
rainbow what happened?
rainbow i-i don't even like cake!
rainbow i don't have pink in my mane, pinkie!
rainbow ow! cut it out!
rainbow aw nuts, so did i.
rainbow and boy was it!
rainbow yeah, i just dove right in!
rainbow sorry pinkie.
rainbow yes!
rainbow a sonic rainboom? at a wedding?! can you say âbest wedding everâ!
rainbow whoa, what's with all the guards?
rainbow sorry twi. been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
rainbow you sure this is what i should wear? doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
rainbow rarity!
rainbow looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. how did you...?
rainbow best - wedding - ever!
rainbow crystal what?
rainbow a way to protect the empire! you know anything about it or what?
rainbow hold on! you gotta know something!
rainbow it says that they liked jousting
rainbow oh, we have to get this right
rainbow yes we have to make them see
rainbow we can save the crystal ponies with their history
rainbow oh, we have to get this right
rainbow yes we have to make them see
rainbow we can save the crystal ponies... with their history!
rainbow let's do this!twilight ...and harmony has been maintained in equestria for generations since. hmm... elements of harmony. i know i've heard of those before... but where?
twilight oh, sorry, girls... i've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
twilight i know i've heard of the elements of harmony.
twilight spike! spi-ike! spike?
twilight there you are. quick, find me that old copy of predictions and prophecies. what's that for?
twilight oh spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
twilight no, no, no... no, no, no!  spike!
twilight ah! elements, elements, e, e, e... aha! elements of harmony, see: mare in the moon?
twilight mare, mare... aha! the mare in the moon, myth from olden pony times. a powerful pony who wanted to rule equestria, defeated by the elements of harmony and imprisoned in the moon. legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal!  spike! do you know what this means?
twilight take a note please, to the princess.
twilight my dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
twilight threshold.
twilight uh, brink? ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! for you see, the mythical mare in the moon is in fact nightmare moon, and she's about to return to equestria, and bring with her eternal night! something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. i await your quick response. your faithful student, twilight sparkle.
twilight great! send it.
twilight of course!
twilight that's just it, spike. the day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the summer sun celebration! it's imperative that the princess is told right away!
twilight important!
twilight oh, i'm not worried, spike. the princess trusts me completely. in all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
twilight see? i knew she would want to take immediate action.
twilight mm-hm!
twilight yes, yes it does. you know why? because i'm right! i'll check on the preparations as fast as i can, then get to the library to find some proof of nightmare moon's return.
twilight she said to check on preparations. i am her student, and i'll do my royal duty, but the fate of equestria does not rest on me making friends.
twilight thank you, sirs.
twilight um... hello?
twilight well, that was interesting all right.
twilight let's get this over with... good afternoon. my name is twilight sparkle-
twilight friends? actually, i-
twilight [clears throat] well, i am in fact here to supervise preparations for the summer sun celebration. and you're in charge of the food?
twilight as long as it doesn't take too long...
twilight [triangle ringing]
twilight thanks, but i really need to hurry-
twilight [nervous laughter] okay, well, i can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.
twilight sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...
twilight ...fine.
twilight ugh... i ate too much pie...
twilight well, she's not doing a very good job, is she.
twilight nng.
twilight nnnn.
twilight let me guess. you're rainbow dash.
twilight i heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear.  i'm twilight sparkle, and the princess sent me to check on the weather.
twilight practicing for what?
twilight the wonderbolts?
twilight the most talented flyers in all of equestria?
twilight pfft, please. they'd never accept a pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
twilight prove it.
twilight [whooshing noises]
twilight rrgh.
twilight yes, the decor is coming along nicely. this oughta be quick. i'll be at the library in no time. beautiful indeed.
twilight good afternoon-
twilight oh, you mean my mane? well, it's a long story. i'm just here to check on the decorations, and then i'll be out of your hair!
twilight wait! where are we going?! help!
twilight i've... been sent... from canterlot... to-
twilight quick! before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
twilight focus, casanova. what's next on the list?
twilight hello!
twilight oh my, i'm so sorry, i didn't mean to frighten your birds. i'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful.  i'm twilight sparkle.  what's your name?
twilight i'm sorry, what was that?
twilight didn't quite catch that.
twilight well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so i guess everything's in order. keep up the good work!
twilight oookay. [to spike] well, that was easy.
twilight well, in that case we'd better be going.
twilight i am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? this is where i'm staying while in ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
twilight aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
twilight yes, yes, we'll get right on that. well, g'night!
twilight [door slamming]
twilight sorry, spike, but i have to convince the princess that nightmare moon is coming, and we're running out of time! i just need to be alone so i can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. now, where's the light?
twilight very surprised. libraries are supposed to be quiet.
twilight [door opens, music gets louder]
twilight no! all the ponies in this town are crazy! do you know what time it is?!
twilight [mockingly imitates spike]
twilight [door closes, music stops]
twilight ugh, here i thought i'd have time to learn about the elements of harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." i hope the princess was right... i hope it really is just an old ponytale...
twilight this can't be good.
twilight oh no... nightmare moon!
twilight i did. and i know who you are. you're the mare in the moon â nightmare moon!
twilight [ponies gasping]
twilight you're here to... to... 
twilight "elements of harmony, see: mare in the moon"?
twilight she will bring about nighttime eternal.
twilight it's imperative that the princess is told right away.
twilight see? i knew she would wanna take immediate action.
twilight all the ponies in this town are crazy!
twilight i hope the princess was right.
twilight oh no. nightmare moon!
twilight you've been up all night, spike. you are a baby dragon after all. elements, elements, elements... ugh! how can i stop nightmare moon without the elements of harmony?
twilight i read all about the prediction of nightmare moon. some mysterious objects called the elements of harmony are the only things that can stop her, but i don't know what they are, where to find them, i don't even know what they do!
twilight how did you find that?!
twilight oh. there are six elements of harmony, but only five are known: kindness, laughter, generosity, honesty and loyalty. the sixth is a complete mystery. it is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. it is located in what is now--
twilight not so fast. look, i appreciate the offer, but i'd really rather do this on my own.
twilight so, none of you have been in here before?
twilight what's that supposed to mean?
twilight applejack! what do i do?
twilight are you crazy?
twilight that's not true!
twilight phew-wah!
twilight yes, rainbow, i was there, and i'm very grateful, but we gotta-  a manticore!
twilight we've gotta get past him!
twilight rainbow!
twilight how did you know about the thorn?
twilight that ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
twilight pinkie, what are you doing?! run!
twilight tell me she's not...
twilight excuse me, sir. why are you crying?
twilight rarity, what are you-
twilight oh, rarity, your beautiful tail...
twilight we can cross now. let's go. ah!
twilight there it is, the ruin that holds the elements of harmony. we made it.
twilight we're almost there. whoa!
twilight rainbow, what's taking so long? oh no. rainbow! don't listen to them.
twilight the elements of harmony, we've found them. careful, careful!
twilight the book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth element to be revealed.
twilight i'm not sure, but i have an idea. stand back. i don't know what will happen.
twilight aah!
twilight the elements!
twilight [all five ponies talking over each other: >fluttershy
twilight twilight? >applejack
twilight what? >rarity
twilight where did she go? >pinkie pie
twilight what happened? >rainbow dash
twilight what's going on?]
twilight [coughs, gasps]
twilight just one spark. come on, come on. aah!
twilight but... where's the sixth element?!
twilight you think you can destroy the elements of harmony just like that? well, you're wrong, because the spirits of the elements of harmony are right here.
twilight applejack, who reassured me when i was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty!
twilight fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness!
twilight pinkie pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter!
twilight rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity!
twilight and rainbow dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty!
twilight the spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
twilight but it did! a different kind of spark. i felt it the very moment i realized how happy i was to hear you, to see you, how much i cared about you. the spark ignited inside me when i realized that you all are...my friends! you see, nightmare moon, when those elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!
twilight princess celestia.
twilight but... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
twilight that's just it. just when i learned how wonderful it is to have friends, i have to leave them.
twilight oh thank you, princess celestia! i'll study harder than ever before.
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight no problem at all, applejack. i'm glad the goal is lunchtime. all this hard work is making me hungry.
twilight puh-leez, spike, you've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.
twilight [stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] eh, i guess we better get some food.
twilight oh spike, that looks delicious. spike.
twilight it's a letter from princess celestia.
twilight the grand galloping gala!
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight the grand galloping gala! 
twilight wow, great! i've never been to the gala. have you, spike?
twilight aw, come on spike. a dance would be nice.
twilight oh, well in that case, would you like to--
twilight yeah, but--
twilight girls, these are my tickets, i'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?
twilight oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles]  listen to that, i am starving. i don't know about you, but i can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so i'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?
twilight i don't know spike, but i really can't think straight when i'm hungry, so where should we eat?
twilight um, actually--
twilight uh--
twilight uh, listen guys, i haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
twilight gee, fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful?
twilight rainbow dash, were you following me?
twilight applejack, were you following me too?
twilight girls, there's no use in arguing.
twilight eh! this is my decision, and i'm gonna make it on my own, and i certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. now go on, shoo.
twilight [ponies grumble]
twilight and don't worry, i'll figure this out... somehow.
twilight spike, what am i gonna do? all five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. applejack, or rainbow dash? pinkie pie or fluttershy, rarity... oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]
twilight i can't decide!
twilight oh. i would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
twilight what do you think, spike?
twilight i mean about the gala and the ticket and who i should take.
twilight spike, listen. how do i choose? and when i do choose, will the other four be mad at me? i mean, i could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. what if i--
twilight oh thank you. this looks so good. i'm sure everything will be much clearer once i eat.
twilight [ponies galloping]
twilight it's not raining. what's going on?
twilight rainbow dash, what are you doing?
twilight rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?
twilight uh-huh.
twilight rainbow, i am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so i'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.
twilight that's better. 
twilight no, really?
twilight heh heh, oops, sorry.
twilight uh...
twilight ugh, rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. i mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.
twilight uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?
twilight oh, spike.
twilight wait, the grand--
twilight i see what's going on. you're just buttering me up so i give you the extra ticket. well it's not gonna work. you're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. now, if you'll excuse me, i've been trying all day just to get some lunch.
twilight you've got to be kidding me!
twilight [stomach grumbles]
twilight no. no. i don't know who i'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. in fact, i'm less sure now than i was this morning. ugh!
twilight ugh, i never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.
twilight fluttershy, not you too?
twilight it's summer.
twilight you're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
twilight no, no, no! well, this was all very nice of you and angel, but i'm not accepting any extra favors until i've made my final decision, so i'm going to have to ask you to leave.
twilight pinkie...
twilight pinkie.
twilight pinkie!
twilight at least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
twilight we're... gonna... run!
twilight [ponies offer favors]
twilight i didn't even know it was gonna happen. now quick, lock the doors. yaaaargh! i can't decide, i just can't decide. it's important to all of you and i just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and i wanna make you all happy and i can't, i just can't!
twilight spike, take down a note. dear princess celestia,
twilight i've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. so, though i appreciate the invitation, i will be returning both tickets to the grand galloping gala.
twilight if my friends can't all go, i don't wanna go either.
twilight nope. i've made up my mind. spike, you can send the letter now.
twilight it's okay girls. i couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so i would rather not go at all.
twilight a letter from the princess? that was fast.
twilight now we can all go.
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight [stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]
twilight pinkie pie, are you crazy?! run!
twilight we all ready?
twilight is applejack all set?
twilight welcome everypony! today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. a pony whose contributions to--
twilight exactly. and...
twilight what does that have to do with applejack?
twilight oh-kay, that's great. now if i could just make a point without being inter--
twilight --rupted.
twilight anyone else? anyone? no? well then, as i was trying to say... urgh! never mind.
twilight okay. well, thank you applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
twilight was it just me, or did applejack seem a little--
twilight hmm.
twilight what on earth is that pony doing?
twilight hey applejack!
twilight applejack.
twilight applejack. applejack!
twilight what is all this?
twilight applewhat season?
twilight but why are you doing it all alone?
twilight what about all those relatives i've met when i first came to ponyville? can't they help?
twilight fine.
twilight i just did. applejack, you don't look so good.
twilight do you... want some help?
twilight but there's no way you can do it all on your own.
twilight uhm... no?
twilight can i help you?
twilight applejack?
twilight applejack, can we talk? applejack, can we talk?
twilight no. can we talk?
twilight no! i need to talk to you.
twilight i need to talk to you!
twilight rainbow dash dropped in to see me today.
twilight yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
twilight because you're working too hard and you need help.
twilight help! you need help!
twilight ugh.
twilight we came as soon as we heard.
twilight oh no! what happened?
twilight applejack.
twilight applejack, we need to talk.
twilight not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
twilight here, let me help.
twilight aj, think you're beating a dead... tree.
twilight actually applejack, i had something else to talk to you about. i just came back from ponyville urgent care and--
twilight but if you'd just let me help--
twilight ugh. that pony is stubborn as a mule.
twilight [mule neighing]
twilight no offense.
twilight i don't get it.
twilight alright. enough is enough.
twilight alright, applejack. your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. i don't care what you say, you. need. help.
twilight applejack. applejack.
twilight oh, good, you're okay. now applejack, i completely respect the apple family ways. you're always there to help any pony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
twilight i am not taking "no" for an answer--what?
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight my friend applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help any pony. the only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
twilight your faithful student,
twilight twilight sparkle
twilight a bit?
twilight uh-huh.
twilight uh-huh. phew.
twilight isn't she right up there?
twilight hmm?
twilight so pinkie pie, are you sure that this friend of rainbow dash is really so mean?
twilight you know what i think, pinkie pie.
twilight well, i think... you're jealous.
twilight well, yes. jealous. listen pinkie, i don't want to upset you, but just because rainbow dash has another friend doesn't make gilda a grump. i mean, perhaps it's you, pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.
twilight you've met gilda, right? what's she like?
twilight why don't we let gilda blow out the candles, spike. she is the guest of honor after all.
twilight spike.
twilight wow, what was that about?
twilight [ponies talking indistinctly]
twilight hey pinkie. sorry i accused you of misjudging gilda. looks likes i'm the one who misjudged you.
twilight dearest princess celestia,
twilight today i learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. just continue to be a good friend. in the end, the difference between a false friend and the one who is true will surely come to light.
twilight your faithful student,
twilight twilight sparkle
twilight okay, here goes.
twilight [magical chime]
twilight sorry, romeo. as attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight true, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. but what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
twilight oh, spike, stop. i'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in ponyville that know just as much magic as me.
twilight really?
twilight where is this unicorn?
twilight there's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?
twilight spike! shhh!
twilight you see the way they reacted to trixie? i don't want anyone thinking i'm a show-off.
twilight there's no way i'm going to use my magic now, spike. especially since--
twilight i-- i--
twilight uh...
twilight nothing.
twilight what do you mean? i'm nothing special.
twilight i'm not better than anyone.
twilight who, me? i'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of ponyville. no powerful magic here. i, uh... i think i hear my laundry calling. sorry, gotta go.
twilight didn't you see how they hated trixie's bragging, spike? if i go out there and show off my magic, i run the risk of losing them as friends.
twilight no, spike, it's exactly the same.
twilight i don't want to be seen as a bragger like trixie.
twilight [door slam, door open]
twilight uh. please, spike, i said no!
twilight i already told you, spike, i don't wanna show up trixie!
twilight uh, is that what i think it is?
twilight what's going on?
twilight you what!?!
twilight [music from broken cattails]
twilight i'm sorry. please, please don't hate me.
twilight well, i know how much you all hated trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and i just thought--
twilight so, you don't mind my magic tricks?
twilight you are?
twilight that's what i was doing when you came looking for me. i was so intrigued by trixie's bragging that i was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
twilight that wasn't an ursa major, it was a baby, an ursa minor.
twilight and it wasn't rampaging, it was just cranky because someone woke it up.
twilight you don't wanna know.
twilight just let her go. maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. now, about you two.
twilight for starters, you can clean up this mess. and... what do you think, spike? should i give them number twenty five?
twilight i think you're right.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight i have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: i was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that i was hiding a part of who i am. my friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... especially when you're standing up for your friends.
twilight well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. so, uh, how did it go with rarity?
twilight you know, spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. maybe you should just try being yourself.
twilight uh, not this again!
twilight listen up! smoke is spreading over all of equestria.
twilight but don't worry, i've just received a letter from princess celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
twilight it's coming from a dragon.
twilight sleeping.
twilight according to princess celestia, he's taking a nap. his snoring is what's causing all this smoke.
twilight we need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. princess celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. if we do, equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
twilight all right everypony, i need you to gather supplies quickly. we've got a long journey ahead of us. let's meet back here in less than an hour.
twilight all right girls, listen up. i'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
twilight the dragon is in that cave at the very top.
twilight uh-huh. well, we could go this way.
twilight uh-huh. no, we want to avoid that.
twilight uh-huh.
twilight wait! you have to come! your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
twilight oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. spike's got it covered while you're gone.
twilight oh, she's just a little nervous. once we get going, i'm sure she'll be fine.
twilight all right girls, move out!
twilight that is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
twilight girls, this is no laughing matter! fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. what do you think the dragon will be like? fluttershy?
twilight uh, we don't have time for this. what are you doing?
twilight your turn, fluttershy.
twilight come on, fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.
twilight we don't have time for this.
twilight you've got it.
twilight just don't look down.
twilight let's keep it down. according to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. the smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide.
twilight shhh!
twilight oh no! help! ooh!
twilight thanks to you i am.
twilight yeah, we'll just have to  climb over.
twilight we're about to find out. we're here. rainbow dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.
twilight rarity and pinkie pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
twilight [squeaky toy]
twilight applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. but it shouldn't come to that, because fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. is everypony ready?
twilight okay then, we're goin' in. so, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? fluttershy? oh, come on! come on!  we have to do this!  now! every  second longer that dragon  sleeps is another  acre of equestria that is covered in  smoke. ooh!
twilight what?
twilight but fluttershy. you have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
twilight but, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?
twilight oh, fluttershy.
twilight i'm goin' in. he... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing. right?
twilight [ponies agree nervously]
twilight mr. dragon.
twilight excuse me.
twilight mr. dragon.
twilight oh, good, you're awake. please allow me to introduce myself. my name is twilight--
twilight augh! puh! sparkle, and my friends and i are residents here in equestria. ponyville, to be exact. we've come her to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. it's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke.  equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. you understand, don't you?
twilight so, you'll find another place to sleep? 
twilight you mean... getting rid of that dragon?
twilight rainbow! no!
twilight you did it! i knew you could do it.
twilight spike, take a letter.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight i am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, fluttershy, who convinced him to go. this adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. they can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
twilight always your faithful student,
twilight twilight sparkle.
twilight applejack! rarity! applejack! rarity!
twilight come inside girls, quick.
twilight it is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like i do. come on in!
twilight some storm, huh? the pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. i hope you and applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
twilight well, you're welcome to stay if need be. spike is away in canterlot on royal business. i'm home all alone tonight.  you and applejack should totally sleep over! we'll have a slumber party! i've always wanted one of those.
twilight my own personal copy. it's a fantastic reference guide. you should see the table of contents. i've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! this is gonna be so great!
twilight we're giving each other makeovers! eee-hee! we have to do it, it says so in the book.
twilight hurray slumber party!
twilight [loud chewing] hee-hee! isn't this exciting? we'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.
twilight this is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! yay!
twilight this is so awesome!  makeovers, check. ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. who wants to go first?
twilight i've got one! this story is called the legend of the headless horse. it was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. and three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...
twilight ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was -- the headless horse!
twilight ghost story, check. now, who wants s'mores?
twilight ooo!
twilight s'mores, check. now the next item of fun we have to do is truth or dare.
twilight um, i don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. you have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever any pony dares you to do.
twilight you have to. it's the rule.
twilight um, do i ever get a turn?
twilight i, uh, i think we should check off truth or dare and move on. let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? hm, what does this mean? pillow fight?
twilight oh, i get it! pillow, fight! fun! ugh. ah. uh, girls? maybe we should take it down a notch?
twilight maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
twilight enough! it says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two i can't check that off!
twilight i hope you're happy, both of you. you've ruined my very first slumber party. the makeover, the s'mores, truth or dare, the pillow fight... i mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?  sorry i asked.
twilight it's... well, it's not okay. there's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. or at least i haven't found that entry yet. ooh... ah!
twilight baking... bffs... brothers... there's nothing in here about branches.
twilight well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. is that what we're doing right now? does this count as camping?
twilight oh, pretty! where did these come from? they're not in the book either.
twilight nope.
twilight no! only three of your twenty questions left!
twilight why? is it too cold in here for you? i can turn up the heat.
twilight oh! no. and that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!
twilight that's it!
twilight no.  it's that. but it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, i wanted you to be able to win together.
twilight see? we could have been having fun like this all along.
twilight i declare my first slumber party a success!
twilight have fun, check.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight it's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. but i found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you'd just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.
twilight so, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? ugh. how about a week from thursday? oh, how about two weeks from saturday? a month from now?
twilight wow, what a gorgeous day!
twilight i bet all of ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. what? where is everypony?
twilight not that i know of.
twilight not more than usual.
twilight uh... not very likely.
twilight spike! there are no zombie ponies. pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?
twilight okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?
twilight well, i saw her glance this way...
twilight ... and then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
twilight [everyone but twilight gasp]
twilight will you cut that out?
twilight she's a zebra.
twilight a zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice rarity, they're what she was born with.
twilight well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. my books say that zebras come from a far away land. but i've never seen her in ponyville. where does she live?
twilight spike!
twilight wow. catchy.
twilight this is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen zecora do?
twilight oooooh.
twilight oh, my.
twilight good gracious! [normal tone] okay, i'm sorry. but how is any of this bad? maybe she comes to town to visit?
twilight and maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?
twilight i am sure there is an explanation for everything zecora does. and if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.
twilight you ponies are being ridiculous!
twilight pinkie, i eat hay; you eat hay!
twilight spike, you stay here in case apple bloom comes back.
twilight oh brother.
twilight you guys, there's no such thing as curses!
twilight my magic, real magic, comes from within. it's a skill you're born with. curses are artificial, fake magic. it's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. but curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.
twilight ugh... what a dream... curses, schmurses. whoa!  maybe zecora cursed my hair. [laughs nervously and then gasps] or she cursed my horn!
twilight no no no no no! none of these books have a cure! ugh! there has to be a real reason for this! an illness? an allergy?!
twilight i said a real reason. something that points to something real.
twilight "supernaturals"? spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. this book is just a bunch of hooey!
twilight pinkie? what happened?
twilight but fluttershy... seems just fine!
twilight fluttershy? are you okay? is there something wrong with you? would you care to tell us? so... you're not gonna to tell us? yes you're not, or yes you will?
twilight [sarcastic laughter] this is no joke, spike. now start looking for more books so i can find a cure!
twilight it's not a curse!
twilight it's not a hex either!
twilight [everyone but apple bloom and spike shouting at once]
twilight ... or sat on her?
twilight apple bloom is gone too!
twilight well we better go find them. come on girls, let's go.
twilight c'mon girls. we've got to get to zecora's. hurry!
twilight oh pinkie. doesn't sound anything like your song.
twilight scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?  everything is pointing to zecora being... bad. or... what if zecora is just making soup?
twilight or... what if she's making apple bloom soup?!
twilight what if she's making apple bloom soup?
twilight [all ponies scream]
twilight what have you done with apple bloom?
twilight we're onto you zecora. i didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
twilight you ruined my horn!
twilight where is apple bloom!?
twilight because zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
twilight apple bloom, sweetie. you can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.
twilight i think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save apple bloom, we ran into the poison joke. all our problems are just little jokes that played on us.
twilight but the cauldron... the apple bloom soup?
twilight but i tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. what book has this natural remedy?
twilight actually, i do have this book, but i didn't look inside because the title was so... weird. supernaturals: natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super. i...i... i'm so sorry zecora. i had the answer the whole time, if only i had bothered to look inside.
twilight zecora? would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
twilight oh, well... i think we can help you with that.
twilight daisy, we need to talk.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight my friends and i all learned an important lesson this week: never judge a book by its cover. someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. but you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the "contents" of a pony that count. and a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. your faithful student, twilight sparkle.
twilight oh! hurry up spike! this place isn't gonna clean itself.
twilight princess celestia will be here tomorrow!
twilight there's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. i want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
twilight everything's got to be perfect. no time for fooling around.
twilight great idea. you clean, i'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
twilight what happened to the rest of her name?
twilight you can't hang a banner that says "welcome princess celest". take it down and try again.
twilight that looks perfect. keep up the good work.
twilight hello mr. and mrs. cake. how's the banquet coming?
twilight pinkie! what are you doing? those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
twilight they're amazing. what are they?
twilight i'll take one off your hooves. i've never seen anything so... adorable. besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for spike so he won't bother me so much while i'm studying.
twilight a para-what?
twilight a what?
twilight ahhh, typical pinkie.
twilight wow. rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
twilight the better question is, where did they come from? i only had one a minute ago.
twilight the decorations, the banquet, i really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
twilight oh,  what's there to worry about?
twilight spike! wake up! what happened?
twilight where did they come from?
twilight the princess will be here in a few hours.
twilight spike, help me round up these little guys.
twilight fluttershy knows everything about animals, i'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
twilight ...or not.
twilight ugh, do something fluttershy, can't you control them?
twilight if we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
twilight i got it! no pony can herd like applejack.
twilight pinkie!
twilight you're telling me. the princess could arrive at any moment.
twilight maracas? pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
twilight we did it. nice work, applejack.
twilight now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
twilight okay, everyone knows what to do, right? we gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
twilight where did they come from?
twilight we don't have time to keep rounding up these things. what do we do now?
twilight way to go, rainbow dash!
twilight pinkie pie, what have you done?
twilight will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? you're ruining our efforts to save ponyville.
twilight we've gotta do something.  i got it! i'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
twilight they're eating the words. 
twilight zecora, these little guys are devouring ponyville, and the princess is on her way. can you help us, please?
twilight i don't know! is it?
twilight oh no, here she comes.
twilight [ponies scream]
twilight okay, here's the plan. rainbow dash, you distract them.
twilight good. everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of ponyville right over there. we've got less than a minute. zecora was right, we're doomed. oh no, the princess's procession is here. it's all over.
twilight [polka music]
twilight pinkie? we're in the middle of a crisis here. this is no time for your... nonsense?
twilight look.
twilight hello, princess.
twilight so... how was the trip? hit much traffic?
twilight parade? oh. yes, the parade.
twilight an... infestation?
twilight trouble? what trouble?
twilight my... report?
twilight actually, i have. i've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. it's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives , even when they don't always seem to make sense.
twilight thank you, princess.
twilight emergency in fillydelphia.
twilight i think the princess can handle it.
twilight we know pinkie pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
twilight [>rainbow dash
twilight i'm sorry, pinkie.] [>rarity
twilight so sorry, pinkie.] [>fluttershy
twilight sorry, pinkie.] [>applejack
twilight real sorry, pinkie.]
twilight you're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
twilight you saved my reputation with princess celestia, and more importantly, you saved ponyville.
twilight ...or not.
twilight spike, wake up. wake up, wake up, it's winter wrap up day!
twilight winter wrap up!
twilight spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so every pony in ponyville needs to clean up winter. now help me get ready.
twilight no spike, ponyville was started by earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. it's traditional. 
twilight okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. it's a good thing i'm so organized, i'm ready. bright and early. oh... maybe a little too early.
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight those must be the team vests rarity designed. blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. i wonder which team vest i'll be wearing.
twilight oh, this is so exciting.
twilight oh gosh, where should i go? i'm not sure where i fit in. what exactly does everypony do?
twilight the time has come to welcome spring
twilight and all things warm and green
twilight but it's also time to say goodbye
twilight it's winter we must clean
twilight how can i help? i'm new, you see
twilight what does everypony do?
twilight how do i fit in without magic?
twilight i haven't got a clue!
twilight now that i know what they all do
twilight i have to find my place
twilight and help with all of my heart
twilight tough task ahead i face
twilight how will i do without my magic
twilight help the earth pony way
twilight i wanna belong so i must
twilight do my best today,
twilight do my best today!
twilight 'cause tomorrow spring is here
twilight 'cause tomorrow spring is here
twilight 'cause tomorrow spring is here!
twilight everypony belongs to a team. what should i do? where should i go?
twilight rainbow dash!
twilight what are you doing?
twilight oh, can i help? how about if i help clear out the clouds?
twilight right. no wings.
twilight great, now what do we do?
twilight come on spike, this is serious business. winter needs to be wrapped up, and i'm determined to do my part. somehow.
twilight rarity, please tell me there's something, anything i can help you with.
twilight birds' nests?
twilight wow rarity, that one's really beautiful.
twilight would i? yes! where do i begin?
twilight there! it looks just like... yours. oh my.
twilight hw...
twilight wow pinkie pie, you're quite the skater. probably the best skater i've ever seen.
twilight how clever. when the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. well you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in ponyville.
twilight would i?
twilight okay.
twilight uh... maybe on second thought.
twilight oh no, whoa, wow...
twilight yaaaaa!
twilight really?
twilight mm-hmm, yeah, i guess.
twilight well... i'm pretty good with little animals. yeah, i'll go help her.
twilight yaaaaaa!
twilight awww, how cute.
twilight well, i'll help, fluttershy.
twilight okay, let's start there.
twilight [bell rings]
twilight hello? wake up little friends, wherever you are. spring is coming. [bell rings] i wonder which cute little furry creatures i've awoken.
twilight waaa! snakes! snakes!  ugh!   ugh!
twilight all this winter wrap up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
twilight no, spike, i have to do it the traditional way. ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.
twilight no, no, no! i'm gonna find some other way that i can help out if it kills me. 
twilight hey applejack. how's everything going?
twilight well, i'd like to help.
twilight just give me a chance.
twilight ugh...  ugh... 
twilight i could use a come-to-life spell. hwww... here goes...
twilight uh oh. slow down. slow down!
twilight well, see, i just wanted to... 
twilight i'm a winter mess up.
twilight thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
twilight did she say late?
twilight spike! get my checklist and clipboard, stat!
twilight stop everypony. [ponies argue] stop. [bird chirps] sorry. i know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. what you need is organization, and i'm just the pony for the job.
twilight it was a team effort.
twilight gosh, i don't even know what to say. thank you everypony.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight winter wrap up was one of the most special things i've ever been a part of here in ponyville. it helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. how's that, spike? spike?
twilight oh, spike. 
twilight [school bell rings]
twilight [students chatter happily]
twilight whoa, what's been going on in here?
twilight nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.
twilight what's the matter?
twilight uhhhâ¦ i don't follow. how can i help you?
twilight oh no apple bloom. a cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.
twilight i'm sorry but-
twilight alright alright!
twilight i'm sorry sweetie, but i told you-
twilight told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
twilight i'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
twilight i for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
twilight they still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.
twilight dearest princess celestia,
twilight i am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
twilight so you two are doing what, now?
twilight and i'm here to...?
twilight uh, spike, who are you talking to?
twilight ready. set. go!
twilight time, spike?
twilight ready. set. go!
twilight rainbow dash wins the barrel lead!
twilight go!
twilight go!
twilight rainbow dash wins the bronco-buck.
twilight who are you talking to?
twilight 95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!
twilight all right, you two. this is the final event. give it all you've got.
twilight why are you so excited about the race? it's only for ponies.
twilight sorry, spike. i guess that job's already taken.
twilight i'm racing.
twilight i'm not joking.
twilight i am not an egghead, i am well read.
twilight well, no, but i do know a lot about running.
twilight books. i've read several on the subject.
twilight scoff if you must, rainbow. but the running of the leaves is a ponyville tradition, and since i'm here to learn, i've decided i should experience it myself.
twilight i know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
twilight she did not.
twilight she did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
twilight just be careful!
twilight don't you ponies ever look where you're going? you tripped on a stump. see?
twilight rainbow, applejack would never cheat. it was just an accident.
twilight remember, rainbow, this is just a game.
twilight oh my, whitetail wood is just lovely. hey, rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?
twilight except that the other racers just passed you.
twilight forgive me, girls. i know i'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the running of the leaves actually involve running?
twilight oh no, but i did get fifth place, which is rather good considering that i've never run a race before.
twilight exactly. i paced myself, just like my book said. then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, i sprinted to the finish.
twilight well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.
twilight it's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
twilight shh... can't you see rarity is trying to concentrate?
twilight looks like a dress.
twilight oh, so very sorry to trouble you, rarity, but i need a quick favor. could you please fix the button for me? it's my dress for the grand galloping gala.
twilight oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, rarity, but i can't let you do that. it would be so much work. this dress is fine.
twilight but...
twilight well, in that case... thank you for your generosity, rarity. knowing your handiwork, i'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
twilight what a great idea! if you're sure you can handle it.
twilight wow... they're...
twilight yes! something.
twilight they're very nice...
twilight i guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
twilight [collective yeah]
twilight well, in that case... thank you again, rarity.
twilight now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. orion has three stars on his belt, not four.
twilight that constellation is canis major, not minor.
twilight gotta balance style with adherence
twilight oh my!
twilight thank you, rarity.
twilight the bigwig fashion hotshot in canterlot?
twilight wow!
twilight oh dear.
twilight you're not a laughing stock, rarity...
twilight shhh! come on out and talk to us.
twilight now what do we do?
twilight she only has one cat.
twilight like you should have let you do for our outfits. those first dresses you designed were perfect.
twilight maybe not.
twilight "dear princess celestia. this week my very talented friend rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. and i learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. in other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth." 
twilight tuh! nuh! uh! nyuh!
twilight [magic chimes]
twilight eyes over here, spike!
twilight for this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-
twilight spike! this magic needs our full attention to make it happen. there's no other way!
twilight ugh, never mind her. she's just being pinkie pie.
twilight pinkie pie? what in the wide-wide-world of equestria are you up to?
twilight actually, pinkie, i haven't the slightest idea.
twilight oh, pinkie, it's not gonna rain. why there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!
twilight of course you did.
twilight oh, really? did your pinkie sense tell you that, too?
twilight c'mon, spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.
twilight oh, come on. she said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. a coincidence, nothing else to it.
twilight oh, pinkie, please. nothing else is gonna fa-aaah!
twilight oh, please.
twilight honestly, spike, she did not. two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.
twilight oh, wait. don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?
twilight huh?  a bath? this thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
twilight phhhhft.
twilight is your knee pinchy now?
twilight how come your knee didn't get pinchy?! that isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!
twilight okay, okay... i get it.
twilight well, i still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. it's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
twilight huge! for one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. it only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. with you, uh, it makes no sense at all!
twilight combos?
twilight yeah, sure.
twilight ugh!
twilight [beeping noises of a truck backing up]
twilight ughhh... you said that combo meant 'beautiful rainbow'.
twilight i don't believe this.
twilight hmm...
twilight okay. now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
twilight any twitches yet?
twilight now? anything?
twilight are you kidding me?! after a whole day of non-stop twitching, now that i've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?
twilight that makes no sense!
twilight i will not believe in anything i cannot explain.
twilight oh my gosh, what? what is it?!
twilight [pinkie pie's stomach growls]
twilight urgh... you know what?   just forget it! i don't need to know if this is real or not. i don't need to understand it! i don't even care!
twilight rrrrgh... did you two plan this?
twilight urgh! this is ridiculous. this can't be happening. this makes no sense. i have to figure this out.
twilight [frog croaks]
twilight [frogs croaking]
twilight ah!
twilight honestly, spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?
twilight no! i'm doing scientific research. i'm observing pinkie pie, scientific name: pinkius piecus, in its natural habitat.
twilight there's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and i'm getting to the bottom of it. so, shh. come on, pinkius piecus is on the move.
twilight hm... itchy nose...
twilight a-ha, that makes no sense. see? she's hiding like something's about to fall out of the sky, but a twitchy tail means that something's about to fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.
twilight [theremin music]
twilight [swarm of bees buzzing]
twilight this proves...
twilight ...perhaps conclusively, that--
twilight spike! where are you going? i'm trying to teach you the value of scientific--
twilight [swarm buzzing]
twilight [comical "sting" noises]
twilight ow! ouch! ow! 
twilight smelling a flower.
twilight probably that the flower smells good. wait. i'm getting something. ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.
twilight oh, ho. you really, really believe this stuff, don't you? here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. you see? i promise you there's nothing to fear from that-- wo-o-ah! ow! ugh! ow! ow!
twilight okay, take this down: twitchy tail.
twilight hush, spike! we can't let pinkie know we're here, remember?
twilight ugh, spike honestly, you're overreact--
twilight ugh!
twilight you mean you knew all along?! why didn't you tell me?
twilight urgh!
twilight calm down everypony. all we know right now is that pinkie pie just got a case of the shivers. that's all.
twilight i don't. i just want to be there to see the look on pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
twilight cold? need a jacket or something?
twilight will you two stop? she's fine, i'm sure of it.
twilight sorry, i know it's not nice to gloat but... aha! i told you there was nothing to worry about and i was right. pinkie pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a  doozy, and  and the only  doozy here is how right i am.
twilight pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but  ugh, what is that smell? but what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing  in anything you can't see for yourself.
twilight i see it... but i don't believe it!
twilight [hydra roars]
twilight pinkie! come on!
twilight everypony up that hill!
twilight coming, spike! hang on!
twilight [hydra growls]
twilight i think we're gonna make it.
twilight ugh, he'll be up here in no time! quick, one at a time, cross!
twilight no.
twilight no!
twilight no small rodents of any kind!
twilight oh... what would a brave pony like rainbow dash do? chaaarge!
twilight [hydra chirps]
twilight i'll never make it!
twilight i will not!
twilight [hydra roars]
twilight y-ugh! no! oh no! noooo! wa-a-a-ah! ugh! blegh!
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight i don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at froggy bottom bog, and i'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. i mean that hydra--
twilight pinkie?
twilight huh?
twilight huh? but i-- what?! the hydra wasn't the doozy?! how could it not be the doozy?! what could be doozier than that?!
twilight rrrgh... [flames and growls] ooh... i give up...
twilight the fight. i can't fight it anymore. i don't understand how, why, or what, but pinkie sense somehow... makes sense. i don't see how it does, but it just does. just because i don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
twilight eyup, i guess i do.
twilight what? what is?
twilight oh, good, spike, you're here. take a letter.
twilight dear princess celestia, i'm happy to report that-- spike, what have i been saying about focus?
twilight what's wrong spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
twilight pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. what else can i do?
twilight "i am happy to report that i now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. it just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
twilight "always, your faithful student, twilight sparkle."
twilight i wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
twilight last one. thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books guys. it was a crazy week of studying.
twilight what are you two arguing about?
twilight what's that?
twilight what's a sonic rainboom?
twilight wow. if you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!
twilight well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.
twilight go on what?
twilight owaa! ugh. how am i supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
twilight here it is! a spell that will allow earth ponies to fly for three days. ooh, it looks really difficult... i'm not sure i can do it.
twilight ok... but who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
twilight heere goes. [grunts and screams]
twilight i think it worked!
twilight i found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. so i found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
twilight yes!
twilight be careful with those wings, rarity. they're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.
twilight rarity. we're supposed to be helping rainbow dash relax, remember? put your wings away and stop showing off!
twilight rainbow dash. are you ok? you don't look so good.
twilight i loved number seven. doing fifteen barrel-rolls in a row can't be easy.
twilight oh no! her wings evaporated into thin air!
twilight princess.
twilight i did princess, but i think rarity learned even more than me.
twilight hello, fluttershy.
twilight i'm heading to the everfree forest, to zecora's, to get some of my favorite tea.
twilight of course! how about you? what are you doing with the girls?
twilight wow. sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? you sure you can handle it?
twilight what... what happened?
twilight [chicken squawking]
twilight this is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. i was wrong about you. you certainly do know how to handle those girls.
twilight hmm? how so?
twilight you and rarity both. good morning, rarity.
twilight [closing credits]
twilight what is going on here?
twilight girls, i think you're going about this the wrong way. instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?
twilight my little ponies! you're missing the point. think about the things you already enjoy doing. think about what you're already good at.
twilight "ghost, goblins and ghoulish figures"? good heavens, girls. what do you need a book like this for?
twilight what do you think they're up to?
twilight my little ponies! how are you doing?
twilight don't worry. you're gonna be amazing. remember, just stick to what you know best. i can't wait to hear you sing, sweetie belle.
twilight oh?
twilight oh?
twilight costumes?
twilight really, girls? are you sure...
twilight break a le...
twilight uh... good luck!
twilight congratulations, ponies! job well done.
twilight hey, you don't sound too excited.
twilight oh, girls...
twilight oh? tell me. i'd love to make a special report to the princess.
twilight yes? and...
twilight yes? yes?
twilight and that is...?
twilight one day...  one day...
twilight spike, can you breathe now?
twilight good. now tell us what you know.
twilight creepy guys?
twilight come on, girls! let's get started.
twilight hello!
twilight quick! we gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
twilight oh, rarity...
twilight ooh.
twilight poor rarity. what are we gonna do?
twilight spike, it is very noble of you...
twilight ...to sacrifice the gem rarity gave you.
twilight applejack!
twilight um... which way do we go?
twilight all these tunnels... how are we ever gonna find rarity?
twilight but spike, rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.
twilight oh my gosh! you're right! rarity showed me how she did it a while back. if i can just remember...
twilight we're getting close. i can feel it.
twilight [rarity crying]
twilight and just what do you think you're doing?
twilight eh... fine. 
twilight excuse me?
twilight i can't wait to write to princess celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
twilight just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. in fact, by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
twilight oh, doesn't that hurt?
twilight i promise.
twilight give me a break. everypony already knows how you...
twilight but...
twilight my lips are sealed. though i'm pretty sure rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
twilight she hardly took any pictures.
twilight oh, rarity. i'm so sorry. is there anything we can do?
twilight i'm sure she just got tied up.
twilight rarity! fluttershy is your friend.
twilight you have my word. losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
twilight wow! you look great!
twilight sorry.
twilight feel better?
twilight of course.
twilight i swear.
twilight cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [pokes her eye] aargh!
twilight oh, really? well... if you wanna know the truth, rarity...
twilight [pinkie pie disapproves]
twilight nothing!
twilight i was just thinking. if you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.
twilight but rarity told me...
twilight [pinkie pie eats an apple in a menacing way]
twilight uhhhhhh..
twilight i guess you're right.  you're right. you're right, you're fight, you're right!
twilight don't you see? on her own, fluttershy could never do something unattractive. but if i used my magic to help her do something unattractive on her next fashion show, no one would ever want her to model again. and if fluttershy no longer has to be a model, rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. and i'll no longer have to keep their secrets! it's the perfect plan! you can't tell anyone about it. promise me you won't tell anyone?
twilight so you do promise or you don't?
twilight obviously.
twilight they love you for being you. so all i have to do is make you not be you. just leave it to me.
twilight but rarity...! [covers mouth]
twilight because you ha...! [covers mouth]
twilight of course she did! because...! [covers mouth]
twilight but... fluttershy doesn't... ugh! [puts her head into a flower pot]
twilight spike has a crush on rarity! [covers mouth]
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. but you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.
twilight did you get all that, spike?
twilight you're right. that was wrong of me and i'm very sorry.
twilight now will you take down my letter to princess celestia?
twilight uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. we've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
twilight what's going on?
twilight did you say she was a tree?
twilight ya know she's not a tree, right?
twilight well that was kind of huffy.
twilight a buffalo stampede!
twilight they're getting awfully close to the train.
twilight [all shouting indistinctly]
twilight and spike!
twilight how did you escape from the buffalo?
twilight look... both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. there must be something we can do.
twilight we've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt.
twilight listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we â
twilight if we could just sit down and talk we could â
twilight ... why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
twilight dear, princess celestia. friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. even the worst of enemies can become friends. you need understanding and compromise. you've got to share. you've got to care â
twilight it's all right, sirs. she's on the list.
twilight i'm so glad you could make it, fluttershy. it wouldn't be the same without you.
twilight oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. i just know princess celestia is gonna love that about you. i mean, i hope she will... i mean, of course she will!
twilight oh, it's not that. i just want the princess to approve of my friends.
twilight and read about you in my letters. but this is the first time she spent any real time with you. i want everypony to make a good impression.
twilight oh...
twilight well, spike, i don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.
twilight hi, fluttershy! i just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today...  what is celestia's pet doing here?!
twilight oh no. nonononononono! this is bad.
twilight but... but... she doesn't belong to you!
twilight without telling anypony?! without asking permission?!
twilight i know you had good intentions, but you have got to return princess's pet!
twilight if we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. 
twilight really? you don't say!
twilight [excessive coughing]
twilight it's that dry night air.
twilight well... day air's even drier. you guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. philomena, was it? thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. bye! phew... what are you doing?!
twilight we can't now!
twilight you have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
twilight well... no. but it can't be anything good. she might banish you from equestria. or throw you in a dungeon. or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to.
twilight okay. granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?
twilight that's very noble of you. i'll write to you when you're banished. unless i'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. then you'll have to write to me. deal?
twilight did you give her any kind of medicine?
twilight then you have to make her take it. you can't be such a pushover, fluttershy! you need to show this patient who's the boss. make her straighten up and fly right!
twilight no excuses!
twilight done. okay, what else?
twilight there you go.
twilight tough love, baby. you want her to get well, don't you?
twilight next!
twilight one step ahead of you.
twilight what's this soup over here? smells delicious.
twilight oh, she'll eat it, all right.
twilight hey! where are you going?
twilight beg your pardon!
twilight sorry, but we've gotta find...
twilight yes, your majesty, there's been a terrible accident.
twilight no, princess. fluttershy didn't know any better. it was my fault.
twilight but you were only trying to help.
twilight will ya let me do this? she'll go easier on me.
twilight no, it's my fault!
twilight fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of philomena for you.
twilight should i write you a letter about that lesson, princess?
twilight as a young filly in canterlot, i always wanted to go to the summer sun celebration, where princess celestia raises the sun.
twilight and i saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing i've ever seen. i poured myself into learning everything i could about magic. my parents decided to enroll me in princess celestia's school for gifted unicorns. it was a dream come true! except for one thing... i had to pass an entrance exam!
twilight i knew this was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and i was about to blow it!
twilight ...yesyesyesyes...
twilight ...yesyes, yeeees!
twilight um... yes.
twilight this is uncanny! if that explosion didn't happen when it did, i would have blown my entrance exam. rainbow dash, i think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!
twilight dear princess celestia.
twilight today i learned something amazing. everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. if you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. who knows? maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
twilight just write it, spike.
twilight this meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
twilight you know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.
twilight we better get a move on!
twilight spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
twilight scrolls?
twilight i can see that. once again you've read my mind, spike. and that is why you are my number one assistant.
twilight that is why you are my number one assistant.
twilight i said... come on, let's get going. wait! i almost forgot. i wanna bring the "astronomical astronomer's almanac to all things astronomy".
twilight you know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?
twilight hey! what's taking my number one assistant so long?
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight i was sure i put the astronomer's guide back. the book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
twilight thanks, spike. you're such a flatterer.
twilight and a number one assistant, right?
twilight spike, that's enough.
twilight wow...
twilight spike made them. speaking of, spike, can you bring us some punch? spike?
twilight aww... he's worked himself to the bone.
twilight goodnight, spike.  sweet dreams, number one assistant.
twilight "the study of comets. comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of non-volatile grains and frozen gasses. they..."
twilight "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
twilight shoot! oh... this is a job for spike. if only he were awake...
twilight wait! don't go! don't be afraid. thank you for returning my scroll.
twilight gosh, it's cold tonight. say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while i work?
twilight now, where was i? oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
twilight spike, don't worry.
twilight it's okay. owlowiscious did them for you.
twilight he's our new junior assistant. he's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
twilight spike, don't worry. he's just here to help out a little. now, i have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to owlowiscious? he's in the library.
twilight replace him? hah! that's crazy! spike knows he can't be replaced.
twilight hey, spike! can you fetch me that book called "two-headed myth...
twilight thanks, owlowiscious. hey, spike, no worries. owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. oh, and gee! i guess i need "ferrets of fairyland too".
twilight climb down from there before you fall.
twilight shoot!
twilight my last writing quill. it's broken.
twilight spike, wait! wait!
twilight oh, spike. i was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.
twilight oh, no no. there are quite a lot of them.
twilight poor spike. he'll come around. he's genuinely a good little guy.
twilight spike. what is this? you said this book was missing. well, owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. how did it get this way?
twilight i've seen a dragon lie. i'm very disappointed in you, spike.
twilight spike! i don't know what upsets me more. that you deliberately tried to set up owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! you've let your jealousy get the best of you, spike. i am truly disappointed. this is not the spike i know and love.
twilight spike! over here!
twilight hurry! hop on! it's too dark! i can't see!
twilight spike. we were so worried about you. i was so worried about you. why did you run away?
twilight spike. sure, i was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! and friend. and you always will be. it's just that sometimes i need some help at night. i can't ask you to stay up late. you're a baby dragon and you need your rest. owls are nocturnal. so i asked owlowiscious to help. but not to take your place. no one could ever replace you, spike. not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.
twilight and i'm sorry too, spike. i should have been more sensitive.
twilight he forgives you, spike.
twilight it was your ketchup covered feet. owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
twilight i know princess celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
twilight hey, spike. why don't you write to princess celestia? and tell her what you've learned?
twilight i know. but nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
twilight oh, spike.
twilight who? spike! you kno... oooooh... 
twilight oh! hi, pinkie pieâ¦
twilight [>pinkie pie]

twilight bob for apples, cut a rug
twilight and when the party's over
twilight we'll gather 'round for a group hug
twilight no need to bring a gift
twilight being there will be enough
twilight birthdays mean having fun with friends

twilight so, please, oh please r.s.v.p
twilight and come, and be our guest!
twilight a blast!
twilight uh, i think iâm gonna pass. great party though. we should do this again soon.
twilight oh! hi, pinki-
twilight pardon me?
twilight âyouâre invited to âgummyâs after-birthdayâ party. this afternoon at 3 oâclock.â
twilight this afternoon? as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
twilight oh, gosh. i wish i could make it, but iâve gotten a bit behind in my studies. iâve really gotta hit the books.
twilight please do.
twilight iâll keep that in mind.
twilight shh! is pinkie pie around?
twilight good. i donât wanna her to know anything about this.
twilight thanks, and remember, not a word to pinkie pie. hey! whatâs with the tin can? 
twilight i donât think so.
twilight me too.
twilight [in unison] surprise!
twilight farewell party?
twilight if this is a farewell party, why does the cake i picked up from sugarcube corner say, âhappy birthday, pinkie pie?â
twilight itâs okay, pinkie pie. it could have happened to any of us.
twilight huh?!
twilight dear princess celestia, i am writing to you from the most delightful party. iâm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart. your faithful student, twilight sparkle.
twilight yeah, why not? letâs have a party for gummy. 
twilight pinkie! please stop shouting, i'm trying to concentrate.
twilight perfect! i'm ready.
twilight all right, spike.
twilight thanks. but that's just the start. fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
twilight you have my word.
twilight ta-da!
twilight [collective: oh. uh. ah. that's a choice. interesting.]
twilight neat, huh? and don't worry. they'll be mice again at midnight.
twilight wait! come back! those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. how will we get to the gala?
twilight oh. yeah. right.
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight don't worry, spike. we'll all get to spend some time together.
twilight i can't believe we're finally here. with all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... the best night ever!
twilight at the gala
twilight at the gala (at the gala), with the princess (with the princess)
twilight is where i'm going to be (she will be)
twilight we will talk all about magic and what i've learned and seen (she will see)
twilight it is going to be so special as she takes time just for me!
twilight to talk!
twilight princess celestia!
twilight oh, i'm so excited to be here! we have so much to catch up on.
twilight that's just what i was hoping you'd say.
twilight princess! i've been so excited to spend time with you and...
twilight looks like getting a chance to talk to the princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
twilight this isn't what i hoped.
twilight no!
twilight ...i'm gonna make this...
twilight well... it can't get any worse.
twilight uh... eek!
twilight i just hope princess celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the gala.
twilight pardon me, princess, but tonight was just awful.
twilight it is?
twilight you're right, princess. friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
twilight yes, spike. you were right.
twilight don't worry everyone. i've learned a new spell that'll fix everything.
twilight my fail-safe spell... failed. what do we do?
twilight hmm, time for plan b. rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky?
twilight applejack, i need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to earth.
twilight you see, spike? you should never give up. there's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.
twilight come on girls. princess celestia wants to see us all in canterlot immediately!
twilight princess celestia, we came as fast as we could.
twilight is this about the weather? and the animals' weird behavior? what's happening out there? why isn't my magic working? is thereâ
twilight no longer connected?
twilight but why us? why don't you-
twilight princess celestia, you can count onâ
twilight don't listen to her, princess. we'd be honored to use the elements of harmony again.
twilight the elements! they're gone!
twilight you seem to know our strengths, too?
twilight pinkie!
twilight twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! that's it! i bet discord hid the elements in the palace labyrinth!
twilight thanks, princess. we won't let you down.
twilight your horn! my horn! ahhh!
twilight give us our wings and horns back!
twilight never fear, girls. we have each other!
twilight all right, girls, let's do this!
twilight stay calm, girls! everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!
twilight applejack! thank goodness! i thought i heard voices over here. who were you talking to?
twilight what?
twilight did applejack just...? come on, twilight! applejack wouldn't lie.
twilight pinkie pie! are we glad to see you!
twilight pinkie? what do you suppose has her so upset? it's not like her.
twilight weird. better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
twilight rarity! are we glad to see... why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
twilight fluttershy! i'm so glad to see a friendly face. this awful labyrinth is getting to every pony.
twilight [pinkie blows a raspberry at twilight]
twilight uh...
twilight what is happening to my friends?
twilight you're welcomeâ
twilight must... find... rainbow dash. as a team... we're unstoppable. rainbow dash won't let us down.
twilight now i know that's a lie.  how can it be?
twilight [thunder, cracking]
twilight princess celestia, we came as fast as we could.
twilight the elements! they're gone!
twilight who are you talking to?
twilight what? pinkie pie! are we glad to see you!
twilight what is happening to my friends?
twilight girls, why are you all acting like this?
twilight we need to stick together.
twilight stop it, discord. you're not playing fair.
twilight how are we supposed to find the elements of harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
twilight but...but..
twilight think, twilight, think! "find the elements back where you began." back where you began.
twilight ugh. i just want to go home... wait a minute...home! "back where you began!" the elements must be in ponyville! come on, girls. i'm certain this is what discord's riddle really meant. if we get back to the library, i have a book that i just know could give us a clue. ah!
twilight wah! ahh! discord's turned our dirt roads into soap.
twilight ugh.
twilight i can't picture anything. it's too dark. 
twilight ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? not if i have anything to say about it.
twilight okay, we're here. everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?
twilight pleeeease, we've gotta hurry!
twilight tom?
twilight you're not going in without him, are you?
twilight fine!
twilight oh, for the love of...
twilight don't ask. i need you to help me find something.
twilight fluttershy, i've had just about enough... 
twilight ugh. no time to explain. we've got to find the reference guide to the elements of harmony before somepony does something she'll regret.
twilight fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!
twilight hey! applejack, give me that book!
twilight pinkie! you guys! stop it right now!
twilight hey, do you even know what you just stole?
twilight [strained groan] give me that book! where is she? where's rarity?
twilight lies!
twilight [cat yowl, fighting noises]
twilight get back! all of you! this is my book. and i'm going to read it!  the elements!
twilight the elements! they were here all along!
twilight see girls? we did it! we found the elements of harmony! together!
twilight you don't even care, do you?
twilight i never thought it would happen. my friends... have turned into complete jerks! necklace! necklace! necklace! necklace! and... big crown thingy! come on everypony, let's go!
twilight nope. we've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder and the brute. that just about covers it.
twilight congratulations spike, you're the new rainbow dash. now let's go!
twilight too bad, you're rainbow dash. now let's go defeat discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!
twilight move! look out, here comes tom!
twilight discord! i've figured out your lame riddle. you're in for it now!
twilight formation, now!
twilight rainbow dash, get over here. all right, let's get this over with.
twilight what's going on?
twilight who are you talking to?
twilight fine! leave! see if i care! i don't need you guys either! with friends like you, who needs...enemies...?
twilight not anymore...
twilight pack your things, spike, we're leaving.
twilight don't ask where we're going, 'cause i don't know yet. just not here.
twilight these are all the letters i've written to the princess since i've lived in ponyville. but why would she send them back?
twilight "real friends don't care what your cover is. friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. and like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through. the best thing to do is stay true to yourself. everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. maybe even before she's met them."
twilight spike! spike, it's all so clear! can't you see? discord's trying to distract us from what's important. he knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. do you remember what i said the first day we arrived in ponyville? i told you that the future of equestria didn't rest on me making friends. but the opposite is true! the friendships i've made since i've been here are what saved equestria from night mare moon. and now they need to save it from discord!
twilight you're right, spike. i've got to fight for my friendships. for them. for me. for equestria!
twilight oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? i'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
twilight applejack, i'm here to fight for our friendship.
twilight snap out of it. this isn't you! you're not a liar.
twilight i already have. come on!
twilight without rainbow dash, we can't use the elements.
twilight rainbow dash!
twilight we've been looking everywhere for you!
twilight discord's still on the loose! we need you to help us defeat him with your element, loyalty!
twilight time for plan b.
twilight ugh...
twilight come on, fluttershy, we've got to catch her. hyah!
twilight if you can't catch her, discord wins!
twilight okay, applejack, last rope! make it count!
twilight maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
twilight not as wonderful as friendship.
twilight i'll tell you what we've learned discord. we've learned that friendship isn't always easy. but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for.
twilight all right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!
twilight quill.
twilight parchment.
twilight extra ink.
twilight extra extra ink.
twilight is that everything on the checklist?
twilight great. now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things i have to get done by the end of the day. ready?
twilight item 1: create checklist of the things i have to accomplish by the end of the day.
twilight how are we doing spike?
twilight hmm... seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
twilight sounds like we're ahead of schedule. what's next?
twilight uh, i only ordered twelve.
twilight oh, that was very thoughtful of you. it's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. see?
twilight it's just that i'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and i don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
twilight not to worry, i'll just move some of this one to... hmm... i think i may have scooped too much... oops! now those two have more. let's just try this again... hmm, no, that won't do. let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. a little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... i'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!
twilight okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list. very efficient! and a little bit gross.
twilight almost everything!
twilight we haven't sent a letter to princess celestia this week?!
twilight bad? bad? of course it's bad! i'm supposed to send princess celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson i've learned about friendship! not every other week, not every 10 days, every single week!
twilight ohh... where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!
twilight when did we send the last one?
twilight and today is...
twilight argh! nononononononono! if i don't send her a letter by sundown, i'll be... tardy!
twilight tar-dy, spike! late, i'll be late! oh, how could i let this happen? i'm usually so organized. i've never been late with an assignment.
twilight i'm afraid to take that chance, spike. this is the ruler of all of equestria we're talking about. the pony who holds my fate in her hooves! what if she doesn't forgive me?
twilight what if instead she starts thinking i'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
twilight what if she makes me come back to canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove i've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! what if i don't pass?!
twilight she's my teacher. do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? they send them back a grade! but she won't just send me back a grade. she'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
twilight huh?
twilight you're right. i have no reason to worry. because i'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to princess celestia before sundown!
twilight so... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that i as a good friend can help you solve?
twilight then it looks like i'm going to have to find somepony who does.
twilight you've got this, twilight. you still have plenty of time to get that letter to princess celestia! has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!
twilight rarity!
twilight don't worry, rarity! i'm here!
twilight what's happened? are you alright?
twilight never fear rarity. as your friend i'll do my best to help you fi--
twilight so... you just lost your ribbon?
twilight ...but now you've found it?
twilight ...and nothing else is bothering you? nothing that i, as a good friend could help you with?
twilight yes?
twilight measuring tape? sure.
twilight no need to panic. rarity is just one pony. i'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
twilight what in the world...? rainbow must be angry with applejack! she must hate her guts! oh wonderful! rainbow dash! stop! listen, rainbow. i know you're upset with applejack, but don't worry. whatever it is that has come between you two, i'm sure that i, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.
twilight oh, rainbow dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! i can tell you two must've had a terrible fight. now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with applejack.
twilight you don't? then why are you destroying her property?
twilight i can't believe i wasted all that time. i should have just come here first. fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. as a good friend, i'll be able to help her.
twilight fluttershy?
twilight how can this be happening? of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! what am i going to do?!
twilight it's fine. it'll all be fine. the day isn't over yet. but it will be over soon!  it'll be all over! my time in ponyville! my advanced studies! nono. you're a good student. you can do this. ooh! but what if i can't? you can. you just have to keep it together. keep. it. together!
twilight huh?
twilight the picnic! i should go see my friends!
twilight no! i am not alright.
twilight it's just terrible.
twilight simply awful.
twilight it's the most horrific trouble i've ever been in and i really really really need your help!
twilight my letter to princess celestia is almost overdue, and i haven't learned anything about friendship!
twilight [strangled noises] something awful has happened! if i don't turn in the letter on time, i'll be tardy! tardy!
twilight this is not nothing. this is everything. i need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem i can fix before sundown! my whole life depends on it!
twilight [annoyed groans]
twilight clock is ticking, twilight. clock. is. ticking. keep it together. if i can't find a friendship problem... i'll make a friendship problem!
twilight [insane giggles]
twilight hi girls!
twilight gr-eat. just great. you three look like you're doing great too! looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. this is smarty pants. she was mine when i was your age, and now i want to give her to you!
twilight she even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!
twilight i just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! i'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. so, who wants to play with her first?
twilight (thinking) i gotta think of something! thinkthinkthinkthink twilight, think!  that's it! (normal) ooh, you're going to like smarty pants. and you're going to like her more than anything.
twilight the 'want it, need it' spell. works every time. okay okay, let's break it up. i think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- c'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? don't you think you ought to share?
twilight [annoyed groan] big mcintosh! thank goodness! you've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
twilight oh, thank you so much. now if you could just give her to me?
twilight oh no!
twilight can't... get... a clear shot! 
twilight oh, what have i done?!
twilight don't look at it!
twilight my smarty pants doll! i enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
twilight oh, i had to do something! i had nothing to report to princess celestia! i thought if i couldn't find a problem, i'd make a problem! the day is almost over!
twilight goodbye girls. if you care to visit, i'll be in magic kindergarten, back in canterlot.
twilight ...but...but... i'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. i missed the deadline. i'm a bad student! i'm... tardy!
twilight really?
twilight princess celestia, wait! how did you know i was in trouble?
twilight i'm star swirl the bearded. father of the amniomorphic spell? did you even read that book i gave you about obscure unicorn history?
twilight hi, everypony. great costumes. happy nightmare night, granny smith.
twilight since you moved here from trottingham?
twilight pinkie pie, aren't you a little old for this?
twilight [bell jingles] do you like it?
twilight a clown? look at the borders on these robes. these are hoof-stitched!
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight star swirl the bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
twilight he created more than 200 spells! he even has a shelf in the canterlot library of magic named after him. maybe i should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. i bet everypony would love it! don't you, spike?
twilight hey look, we're here already! should we get something to eat?
twilight rainbow dash, that wasn't very nice.
twilight look what you did to spike.
twilight happy nightmare night, applejack!
twilight she means me, spike.
twilight princess luna!
twilight i'm gonna go talk to her.
twilight no, she's not. i saw the elements of harmony change her back to good! but it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.
twilight princess luna? hi, my name is-
twilight thank you, finally! somepony who gets my costume! uh, i just came to welcome you to our celebration! my actual name is-
twilight and that was a good thing, right?
twilight well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.
twilight you know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. i think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.
twilight lower the volume..?
twilight don't worry, princess. fluttershy can give you some great pointers. she's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice.
twilight fluttershy, it's me, twilight!
twilight [nervous laughter] wait right here.
twilight fluttershy... you remember princess luna?
twilight a little quieter, princess.
twilight better. right, fluttershy?
twilight now you're getting it.
twilight yes! well done.
twilight come on, princess. time for plan b.
twilight my friend applejack is one of the most likeable ponies around. i'm sure she'll have some ideas.
twilight uh... applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.
twilight fire away, princess!
twilight princess, remember! watch the screaming!
twilight it's not over yet.
twilight i'm going to do what i do best. lecture her!
twilight princess.
twilight princess. i'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. but you have to believe me when i tell you that nightmare night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.
twilight [with regret] princess...
twilight no! no shrieking. no screaming or squealing either. okay?
twilight there's something i want you to see. and i promise that it's safe, but you really, really can't shriek. do you promise not to shriek?
twilight pinkie pie, you remember princess luna, right?
twilight rainbow!
twilight she's changed, pinkie! she's not evil or scary anymore! and she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!
twilight huh?
twilight so why do you keep running away and screaming?
twilight fun? pinkie pie, you're a genius!
twilight princess luna! i've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
twilight come with me. i'll explain everything on the way.
twilight just wait.
twilight see? they really do like you, princess.
twilight dear princess celestia,
twilight when you first sent me to ponyville, i didn't know anything about friendship. i met somepony tonight who was having the same problem - your sister, princess luna! she taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! and i'm happy to report that all of ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. and even if my star swirl the bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best nightmare night ever!
twilight three cutie marks. three talents. i've never seen anything like it! i was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. what was it?
twilight yes, spike, you're amazing!
twilight hay fever... the trots...  cutie pox!
twilight cutie pox. this puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the paleopony period!
twilight random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!
twilight it says here there's no known cure!
twilight the cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!
twilight she needs help!
twilight not some pony... some zebra!
twilight zecora! apple bloom has cutie pox! we were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
twilight apple bloom, would you mind writing to princess celestia and telling her what you've learned?
twilight well we had initially planned on inviting rainbow, of course, exceptâ
twilight yeah, like care and attention, love and affection- ugh! and breath mints!
twilight aren't those all the same thing?
twilight hm, something's not right here.
twilight tortoise!
twilight and he's carrying something on his back...
twilight oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, rainbow!
twilight but what about the--
twilight tenacity.
twilight i can think of a few new words.
twilight no, but she is kinda awesome.
twilight [old ponies chattering]
twilight [splintering wood]
twilight call me silly, but i think this whole hero thing might be going to rainbow dash's head.
twilight mm-hm.
twilight are you taking notes?
twilight umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about...
twilight i must say, i was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.
twilight sounds like somepony's jealous.
twilight yup, we all played mare do well at different times.
twilight and i used my magic to fix the dam.
twilight of course we want you to be a hero.
twilight celebrating your accomplishments is natural. but...
twilight what we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.
twilight sounds like you've got a letter to write to princess celestia.
twilight when i got your letter saying you were stuck in canterlot, i asked pinkie pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!
twilight is... that my dress?
twilight it's so... simple. so practical. so me! it's the perfect dress for my birthday party! i love it!
twilight when i told the princess that i was moving the party to canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the canterlot castle ballroom!
twilight i thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
twilight [ponies chattering]
twilight (blowing a party trumpet)
twilight were you at that other party in the garden?
twilight rarity, i'm surprised at you.
twilight i hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
twilight all of those ponies look so posh. and with the grand galloping gala coming up, i bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. very smart!
twilight oh, well you didn't have to do that. you should totally go over there and mingle!
twilight understand what?
twilight why yes, yes you may. a very, very close friend of mine from ponyville made it for me.
twilight i do say. her name is-
twilight oh don't be so modest, this dress you made is beautiful!
twilight [ponies gasp]
twilight [glass shattering]
twilight we all think so!
twilight no distractions. today is too important. re-shelving day. understanding medieval equestria goes in pony history. modern spellcasting. that's classics. the art of the to-do list... actually, i kinda wanna read that again.
twilight spike! what are you laughing at?
twilight [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight uhh... if you guys don't mind?
twilight start with this one.
twilight wow, spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. i've never seen rarity so happy!
twilight just about finished, spike? everypony will be here soon.
twilight not quite everything.
twilight it's over, spike! i'm cleaning that cheek!
twilight never!
twilight spike! uh, sorry, junebug, i think spike might've gotten a little carried away.
twilight what are you doing? you're out here demanding gifts now?
twilight no problem. see you at home later?
twilight wow, what a rough night's sleep, spike. i had the weirdest drea--
twilight i can't believe you! where'd you get all this-- 
twilight i don't know! think back to last night. did something happen? spike? what did you do after i saw you?
twilight spike!
twilight you went to talk to who?
twilight huh?
twilight spike, i'm worried about you. you're usually not so... grabby!
twilight this is spike.  and something's wrong with him.  he used to be half this size! and he keeps trying to take things that aren't  his!
twilight so? what do you think, doctor?
twilight that's not the problem. he's always been a dragon.
twilight okay. thank you, doctor.
twilight thanks anyway. c'mon, spike.
twilight [squee, squeaks]
twilight [watch ticking]
twilight mature? so he's just... growing up? but that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
twilight you mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? but how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?
twilight [laughs nervously]
twilight hey, spike! check out this amazing broom!
twilight [sing-song voice] c'mon, big boy! look at this incredible broom!
twilight fight all you want, i'm not letting you out! oh spike, i just re-shelved this room!
twilight [door closes]
twilight what now?
twilight applejack, help! spike's running wild and i need you to lasso him!
twilight help!
twilight fluttershy? fluttershy!?
twilight what happened?
twilight that was spike!
twilight c'mon, girls!
twilight pinkie pie! stop giving him cake!
twilight he's completely out of control! who knows where he'll go next!
twilight we're getting closer!
twilight oh, isn't canterlot wonderful this time of year?
twilight i have an idea, let's play 'i spy with my little eye' as we walk! i'll go first. i spy... an eight-foot candy cane.
twilight i can't believe that princess celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! do you guys know what an honor this is? for all of us?
twilight fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!
twilight pinkie!
twilight yes, your majesty. did the other pony tribes see reason as i predicted?
twilight about five minutes, your highness.
twilight i actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
twilight what's wrong?
twilight your highness, it's just a stream. we can cross it easily.
twilight what dungeon? look, perhaps if we all calmed down...
twilight look, everypony! the entrance!
twilight [ice cracking]
twilight [windigo roaring]
twilight they must be... windigos!
twilight my mentor star swirl the bearded taught me about them. they're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. the more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!
twilight and now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
twilight [windigo snorts]
twilight nor do i.
twilight i didn't either. nothing like this has ever happened before. but i know it couldn't have been just me. it came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.
twilight we should be so honored that princess celestia chose us! she must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
twilight [wind blowing]
twilight cup cake and carrot cake must be so proud!
twilight and be careful around pumpkin cake.
twilight i have to finish this report for the princess summarizing all my other reports to the princess.
twilight hi! i finished up the work i had to do so i thought i'd stop by and see if you needed any help. whoa!
twilight it's okay, pinkie. i figured you would need some help. that's why i stopped by.
twilight babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
twilight i'm happy to help! it's no trouble-
twilight [door slams]
twilight just do your best, applejack.
twilight quiet, pinkie, i think applejack's coming!
twilight it's from applejack. âfamily and friends, not coming back to ponyville.â
twilight â...don't worry, will send money soon.â that's all there is.
twilight don't worry. we'll search all of equestria if we have to. we'll bring her back.
twilight i don't know how we'll break it to ponyville!
twilight this is dodge junction, girls. applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. let's fan out and try to find her.
twilight tell us what happened, applejack!
twilight yes ma'am.
twilight i don't care what she says, applejack's not telling us something.
twilight we're your cherry sorters. shall we get started?
twilight ...so, aj, how was canterlot? not talking about ponyville, talking about canterlot, totally different town.
twilight was the rodeo fun?
twilight did you meet some nice ponies there?
twilight so you told her about sweet apple acres?
twilight is it because you were insulted when i gave you that book on organized orchards?
twilight well, girls, we seem to be striking out.
twilight i'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from applejack.
twilight oh no, she won't! look, girls!
twilight we'll pay you triple to slow down!
twilight rainbow, go back!
twilight know what?
twilight i am. you won an amazing number of ribbons, just like miss jubilee said!
twilight applejack, you're not a failure.
twilight nn-nn.
twilight isn't this exciting, spike? opening day of cider season!
twilight still worried about flim and flam?
twilight don't worry, applejack, i know you'll win tomorrow!
twilight applejack? are you sure this is such a good idea?
twilight well, good luck.
twilight um, miss mayor! are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?
twilight okay everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.
twilight fluttershy, help applejack with the trees.
twilight pinkie pie, you're on apple catching detail.
twilight rarity, you've got a discerning eye. help granny smith at the quality control station.
twilight rainbow dash, do you think you can help big mcintosh press?
twilight alright everypony, let's save sweet apple acres!
twilight based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!
twilight c'mon, rainbow dash, keep grinding!
twilight we'll just have to work harder! c'mon, everypony!
twilight i'm proud of you, applejack.
twilight integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
twilight that means sweet apple acres is still in business!
twilight hey rarity, hey pinkie pie. what are you looking at?
twilight oh no, oh no, oh no!
twilight ohh.
twilight how is she, doctor?
twilight this is the first story in the series. i own all of them. 
twilight reading is for everypony, rainbow dash!
twilight i think you'd like daring. she's a lot like you. adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.
twilight [door closes]
twilight [clock ticking]
twilight [ball bouncing]
twilight [glass clinking, sloshing etc]
twilight [light clicking]
twilight hi rainbow dash!
twilight we brought your favorite board game!
twilight you go first, rainbow dash!
twilight alright, uh... cloud three.
twilight uh... cloud two?
twilight but you don't lose some. i don't think you've ever lost a game of-
twilight but yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
twilight alright then.
twilight [door closes]
twilight what's going on, rainbow dash?
twilight -'daring do and the quest for the sapphire statue'!
twilight wow, i knew the book was good, but i didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
twilight well, i'm glad that's all this is about.
twilight like i said, i have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!
twilight rainbow dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!
twilight reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
twilight that's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the princess.
twilight oh my goodness, i didn't even see you there. i'm so so sorry.
twilight i've just been reading the most fascinating book about hearts and hooves day. did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
twilight that's right. it even has the recipe.
twilight of course you can. i have another book here that i think you'llâ
twilight i know this is hard for you, pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that cranky is gonna be an exception. he just... doesn't want to be bothered.
twilight rainbow!
twilight oh, hi spike!
twilight frankly, i don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!
twilight it's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
twilight here. now do you see what's wrong?
twilight no, the problem is i just finished planning my schedule for the month, but i forgot to leave time to plan for next month! don't you see? there's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! i could move my meeting with the ponyville hay board to the following tuesday, but then i have to reschedule my lunch with pinkie pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. this is an absolute disaster. my whole year could be thrown off!
twilight oh my gosh, i think i did it! if i can find a way to read the art of invisibility spells, and thornhoof's brief history of canterlot at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! huh?
twilight [magic crackling, wind blowing]
twilight what's going on? 
twilight who are you? i mean, you're me, but i'm me too. how can there be two 'me's? it's not scientifically possible. you are not scientifically possible!
twilight you're from the future?!
twilight what happened to you? the future must be awful.
twilight is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
twilight i can't believe time travel is really possible! how did you, i mean, i figure it out?
twilight really? where? i've never seen them.
twilight is time travel fun, or does it hurt? i have so many questions- [muffled voice]
twilight future twilight? oh no! what was she trying to warn me about? her clothes, her mane, that scar... oh, what a mess she is! ...i mean, i am... or i... will be...  she must want me to prevent whatever horrible thing happens in the future! 
twilight listen, everypony! i've got something really important to say!
twilight this is no laughing matter! we have a crisis on our hooves!
twilight i've just been visited by myself from the future!
twilight this isn't a joke! my future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next tuesday morning!
twilight i don't know! i got sucked back into the future before i could explain!
twilight we'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. rainbow dash, you and the other pegasi spread out over equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and i mean anything.
twilight everypony else-
twilight everypony else, time to disaster-proof equestria!
twilight [cement squelching]
twilight [screw squeaking]
twilight done, and done, and done. applejack, what about the everfree forest?
twilight great.
twilight excellent. well, we've done everything on the list, but still... future twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. i just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
twilight [cerberus roaring]
twilight that's cerberus! he's supposed to be guarding the gates of tartarus, but if he's here, then all of the evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy equestria!
twilight yeah, isn't it great? hey, cerberus! you look like you could use some obedience training! magic obedience training!
twilight [cerberus roaring]
twilight huh?
twilight wow, i knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing.
twilight pinkie.
twilight do you have a ball i can borrow?
twilight [sing-song voice] hey, cerberus! look what i have!
twilight [cerberus panting]
twilight i'll be back as soon as i've returned him to the gates of tartarus. once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.
twilight [cockerel crowing]
twilight great. i got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
twilight oh no!
twilight it's not that, it's this!
twilight the cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future twilight's cheek! we haven't changed the future at all! the disaster is still coming!
twilight if the disaster wasn't caused by cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?
twilight i don't have time for another one of your lectures, spike! this is serious!
twilight i did everything i could think of to change the future. but it didn't work. so maybe it's not what i do... maybe it's what i don't do! if i stand right here and don't move a muscle until next tuesday, i can't possibly do whatever it is that future twilight wanted to warn me not to do!
twilight [through gritted teeth] spike, stop! think of the stomach ache!
twilight what happened?
twilight show me.
twilight show me! oh no! this is the same mane cut as future twilight!
twilight i don't care how it looks! it's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! not doing anything didn't work either! oh, i wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so i could stop it!
twilight what's this?
twilight madame pinkie?
twilight yeah, uh... best one i've seen.
twilight yes, and?
twilight are you sure?
twilight pinkie, i need your pinkie sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future twilight was trying to warn me about!
twilight off by point zero two from yesterday. carry the fifteen... negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
twilight ah, pinkie, i'm glad you're here. can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine and quarter catadioptric telescopes?
twilight so i was thinking, after i came to see madame pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head, see the bandage, just like the bandage from the future...
twilight i had an epiphany after that flowerpot. doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and i couldn't predict the future either, so i only had one other choice. monitor everything.
twilight that way no matter what happens in the future, i'll be ready! i thought i saw something last night in the horsehead nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours i realized, i was wrong!
twilight oh i didn't sleep. i haven't slept since future twilight was here. there are only three days left until next tuesday, i can sleep all i want after that!
twilight pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine and quarter inch catadioptric telescopes?
twilight ah! my eye!
twilight the eye patch...! another sign! nearly all the signs have come true! i haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! if tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. i'll just have to... stop time.
twilight [train chugging]
twilight okay, the canterlot archives are right over there. let's move!
twilight guard! c'mon, you guys!  that was close.
twilight no, there's nothing fun about this!
twilight focus, guys! the only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! time spells are kept in the star swirl the bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. that's why we're sneaking around!
twilight no, it's not fun!
twilight the coast is clear. now slowly lift me into the window so we can- ah!
twilight okay, if my calculations are correct, the star swirl the bearded wing should be right... here.
twilight what is it, spike?
twilight i don't understand. it's supposed to be right here... how are we supposed to find it now?
twilight huh. how'd i miss that? look at all those priceless magic scrolls. there are more than i ever imagined!
twilight what do we do, what do we do?!
twilight [chuckles nervously] thanks!
twilight oh no!
twilight look! i look just like future twilight... the last sign has come true!
twilight come on! it's almost tuesday morning! the disaster could happen at any moment!
twilight i. don't. know!
twilight [birds singing]
twilight nnngh, no! tuesday morning, the disaster! incoming!
twilight why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! is it possible there never was a disaster? that i've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
twilight i don't know. but i do know one thing. i look ridiculous.
twilight and it's all because i couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! well, not anymore. from now on, i'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!
twilight no more late night pacing. if only i had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.
twilight pinkie, you're a genius!
twilight now i can go back and tell past twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
twilight [magic crackling]
twilight twilight, you've got to listen to me!
twilight twilight, please! i have a very important message for you from the future!
twilight that's right, now listen-
twilight please! i don't have much time!
twilight actually, i'm from next tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
twilight the time spells are in the canterlot archives. but that's not-
twilight they're in the star swirl the bearded wing. now, you have to listen to-
twilight i have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and i only have a few seconds so you've got to listen! whatever you do, don't-
twilight [magic crackling]
twilight -waste your time... worrying... about... ugh, i can't believe i just did that.
twilight remember last week when future twilight came to warn me about something? that was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! now i'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! ugh...
twilight huh, i guess you're right, pinkie.
twilight come on, future spike. let's get you home.
twilight [digging sounds]
twilight c'mon, fluttershy, it'll be fun!
twilight but fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
twilight aw fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.
twilight well... yeah!
twilight i don't see any dragons.
twilight no, i don't think so. we're just a little early, and i'm glad we are. this way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!
twilight you look very nice, rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?
twilight wow, amazing!
twilight or act like them.
twilight uuugh! i don't know! for the last time, spike, you were given to me as an egg. i don't know who found you, or where they found you.
twilight i'm sorry, spike.
twilight oh, spike. why don't we do some late-night research? see what we can find out.
twilight of course! i'm sure we can find something.
twilight nothing. nothing in this one either!
twilight i know! it's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!
twilight aw, spike.
twilight that sounds great. i'm famished.
twilight what?!?
twilight hold it!
twilight yes, spike. i couldn't answer your questions. my books couldn't either. i understand why you want to look elsewhere. i truly believe you need to go on this quest. and we have no right to stop you.
twilight we know.
twilight well then, i guess this is goodbye, spike. we can't wait to hear about it when you return.
twilight quest.
twilight we have faith in you!
twilight [through her grin] of course.
twilight [wind blowing]
twilight [rain pouring]
twilight [dragon roaring]
twilight [teacup clinking]
twilight [sounds of exertion]
twilight shh!  we'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! now come on, let's go!
twilight [dragons cheering]
twilight [deep voice] aheh... yeah... hilarious.
twilight how can he just throw that away?! that letter could be something important!
twilight i know, i know!
twilight there's no reason to disrespect princess celestia that way!
twilight let's go! [deep voice] i challenge spike to a tail wrestle!
twilight oof!
twilight [pinching noise]
twilight spike's on his own this time.
twilight [dragons cheering]
twilight forever?!
twilight oh no, this is terrible!
twilight no, rainbow dash, this is all my fault! i encouraged him to go!
twilight rainbow dash, stop! we can't fly!
twilight well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
twilight that's right!
twilight nyuh!
twilight of course. what are friends for?
twilight this is an anemometer. it measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative h<sub>2</sub>o anti-gravitational potential. any other questions?
twilight is that you again, thunderlane? please, we need to have a germ-free environment.
twilight we have 9.3 wing power.
twilight 16.5 wing power!
twilight [hushed, to rainbow dash] tell her!
twilight no, you!
twilight that's wonderful, flitter. much better than yesterday.
twilight do i look like i speak squirrel?
twilight fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!
twilight let's see, with those eight sick pegasi out with the feather flu...  oh no!
twilight no...
twilight ...you might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to cloudsdale!
twilight [taps giant anemometer]
twilight i sure hope so! one hundred and fifty wing power. two hundred and fifty wing power. five hundred wing power!
twilight [water churning]
twilight seven hundred and fifty wing power!
twilight fluttershy! what are you doing here?!
twilight she could sure use it, considering eight pegasi are sick with the feather flu!
twilight are you okay?
twilight oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! i'm sorry, rainbow dash.
twilight but you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
twilight if you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! you should quit, it's not safe!
twilight okay, here we go... one hundred wing power! two hundred... five hundred!
twilight seven hundred! seven hundred and fifty wing power!
twilight seven ninety five! we are so close! fluttershy, they need you up there!
twilight you can make a difference!
twilight do it for equestria! do it for rainbow dash! do it for yourself!
twilight it's moving! she's doing it! seven ninety eight! she surpassed her best wing power number!
twilight she did it! she did it! they all did it!
twilight i like gabby gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
twilight celestia, just like us? gabby gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
twilight i just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. it's gotta be a little embarrassing.
twilight listen to this one. âtwilight sparkle: i was a canterlot snob. a well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says twilight sparkle thinks ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes.â spike!
twilight how could you say such a thing?
twilight but it's all lies! gabby gums prints whatever she wants, she doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! âfluttershy has tail extensions!â âpinkie pie is an out-of-control party animal!â
twilight oh look! according to this one, the cakes are breaking up!
twilight ârainbow dash: speed demon or super softie?â?!
twilight see, rarity? your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!
twilight we've got to put a stop to this once and for all! sweetie belle's on the newspaper staff. maybe she knows who gabby gums is!
twilight thank you for inviting us all to go with you to canterlot for the national dessert competition.
twilight donut joe! what are you doing in ponyville?
twilight well it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep.
twilight pinkie... you're overreacting.
twilight whoa!
twilight um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet pinkie... look.
twilight you mean, who "did it."
twilight well, having read many mystery novels, i know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate.
twilight fine, pinkie. should we start looking for clues?
twilight yes?
twilight pinkie, how could you possibly know?
twilight but it makes no sense!
twilight well first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?
twilight and second, the cake hasn't been sliced, it's been bitten. just look at the teeth marks!
twilight pinkie! there is no laser beam security system. and joe is not sleek, stealthy con mane! he's big, gruff, and messy!
twilight may be?
twilight pinkie... that mousse is a moose!
twilight so you're saying that the culprit is...
twilight pinkie stop! this is ridiculous! look at her!
twilight thank you!
twilight well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. okay pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.
twilight no! but maybe you saw something that will help us.
twilight good... let's retrace your steps.
twilight hm... a-ha! our first clue. i think i know who did it pinkie.
twilight yes, but i need more evidence to confirm. tell me what happened next.
twilight the conductor, huh?  but, that doesn't make any sense. what happened next pinkie?
twilight yes?
twilight interesting. anything else?
twilight oh my, what is that?
twilight [teapot whistling]
twilight what next pinkie?
twilight and when you woke up, half the cake was gone?
twilight by jove, i think i've got it. call everypony back. we have a cake culprit to catch.
twilight i bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
twilight we have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
twilight well you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like this.
twilight pinkie, gustave doesn't have blue feathers.
twilight no pinkie. remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? that's because they flew away. but the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, rainbow dash?
twilight case not solved, because when we went to the engine, i saw the conductor's hat. and inside the hat was... this.
twilight pinkie, remember? you chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. it was, fluttershy.
twilight pinkie! but then another clue confounded my suspicions. you were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. but that's no mystery, that's magic. but when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. has anypony else noticed that rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?
twilight really?
twilight but it isn't. we figured out who ate the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.
twilight well, yes i do. do you?
twilight well pinkie. did you find the devourer of the desserts?
twilight what do you say bakers?
twilight well everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.
twilight care for a bite?
twilight dear twilight, i am sure you are as excited as i am about the upcoming wedding in canterlot. [to the others] wedding?  i will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. fluttershy, i would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.
twilight pinkie pie, i can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.
twilight applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.
twilight rainbow dash-
twilight ...i would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their i do's.
twilight rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.
twilight and as for you, twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: making sure that everything goes as planned. see you all very soon. yours, princess celestia. but... i don't understand. who's getting married?
twilight princess celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of princess mi amore cadenza and...  my brother?!
twilight [<a href="/wiki/theme_song" title="theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
twilight yeah, great news. that i just got from a wedding invitation! not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! thanks a lot, shining armor. i mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as >shining armor] hey, twilight, just thought you should know i'm making a really big decision that changes everything. oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation.  princess mi amore cadenza? who in the hoof is that?! 
twilight sorry, it's just that shining armor and i have always been so close. he's my b.b.b.f.f!
twilight big brother best friend forever?
twilight before i came here and learned the importance of friendship, shining armor was the only pony i really accepted as a friend.
twilight when i was just a filly, i found it rather silly
twilight to see how many other ponies i could meet
twilight i had my books to read, didn't know that i would ever need
twilight other ponies to make my life complete
twilight but there was one colt that i cared for
twilight i knew he would be there for me
twilight my big brother, best friend forever!
twilight like two peas in a pod, we did everything together
twilight he taught me how to fly a kite (best friend forever!)
twilight we never had a single fight (we did everything together!)
twilight we shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
twilight i miss him more than i realized
twilight it seems...
twilight and though he's, oh, so far away
twilight i hoped that he would stay
twilight my big brother best friend
twilight forever...
twilight forever...
twilight he is pretty special. i mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the royal guard.
twilight i guess we are.
twilight i'm just thinking about shining armor. ever since i moved to ponyville we've been seeing each other less and less. and now that he's starting a new family with this "princess mi amore cal-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other.
twilight couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
twilight yeah. congratulate. and then give him a piece of my mind.
twilight i've got something to say to you, mister.
twilight how dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! i'm your sister for pony's sake!
twilight yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. maybe you heard about it?
twilight okay, okay, i get it. you've got a really important job protecting all of canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. but still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? am i not that important to you any more?
twilight you want me to be your best mare?
twilight i'd be honored!  but i'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony i don't even know! when did you even meet this "princess mi amore cadenza"?
twilight cadance? as in the cadance? as in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
twilight ohmygoshohmygosh! cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! she's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
twilight how many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? i only know of one! and you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] you're marrying cadance! you're marrying cadance!
twilight cadance! sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! clap your hooves and do a little shake!
twilight cadance, it's me, twilight!
twilight mmm. check.
twilight did... you see what she...
twilight oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. i don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating cadance] "please, call me princess mi amore cadenza."
twilight gee, maybe her name should be "princess demandy-pants."
twilight bet i can guess what you're all thinking! cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
twilight rarity, she was so demanding!
twilight applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres she threw them in the trash?
twilight no, she was just being fake, and totally insincere!
twilight see? rude!
twilight pinkie pie, you had to have noticed how cadance treated-
twilight nevermind. rainbow dash, you're with me, right?
twilight and i'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know shining armor let alone marry him!
twilight i am not being possessive, and i am not taking it out on cadance! you're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!
twilight we need to talk. i think you're making a big-
twilight she sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
twilight she isn't just unpleasant and rude, she's downright evil!
twilight shining armor's in real trouble! you have to help-
twilight dresses? what are you-?
twilight "new" bridesmaids? what happened to her "old" bridesmaids?
twilight looks like i really am on my own.
twilight [church organ music]
twilight i'm here! i'm not gonna stand next to her. and neither should you!
twilight you have to listen to me!
twilight i'm fine.
twilight i've got something to say! she's evil!
twilight she's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, i saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
twilight because you're evil!
twilight evil! and if i don't stop you you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
twilight i was just trying to-
twilight i was-
twilight maybe i was being overprotective. i could've gained a sister. but instead... i just lost a brother.
twilight he was my big brother, best friend
twilight forever...
twilight and now, we'll never do anything
twilight together...
twilight [smashing noise]
twilight i'm sorry!
twilight "princess celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of princess mi amore cadenza and..."  my brother?
twilight how dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
twilight but i'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony i don't even know.
twilight cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
twilight cadance, it's me! twilight!

twilight we will. we just have to find... there!
twilight stop!
twilight princess celestia!
twilight rarity!
twilight go, go!
twilight they're changelings, remember?
twilight don't let them distract you. we have to get to the elements of harmony. they're our only hope.
twilight it's not your fault. she fooled everypony.
twilight quick! go to him while you still have the chance!
twilight [electric sounds]
twilight your spell! perform your spell!
twilight seriously, though. i get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as cadance to marry you?
twilight love is in bloom
twilight a beautiful bride, a handsome groom,
twilight two hearts becoming one
twilight a bond that cannot be undone because
twilight love is in bloom
twilight a beautiful bride, a handsome groom
twilight i said love is in bloom
twilight you're starting a life and making room

twilight just a test? just a test? princess celestia wants to give me some kind of exam and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!
twilight ahem.
twilight you wanted to see me? to give me a test? i brought my own quills. and plenty of paper to show my work. sorry! sorry!
twilight the crystal empire? i-i'm sorry, i thought i'd studied. i don't think there's anything in any of my books--
twilight you want me to help protect an entire empire?
twilight how do i begin?
twilight my brother is there?
twilight but what if i fail?
twilight but what if--
twilight mm-hm.
twilight i was prepared to do my best
twilight thought i could handle any test
twilight for i can do so many tricks
twilight but i wasn't prepared for this
twilight levitation would have been a breeze
twilight facts and figures i recite with ease
twilight the square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
twilight i could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss
twilight but i wasn't prepared for this
twilight will i fail, or will i pass?
twilight i can't be sure...
twilight my mind is sharp, my skills intact
twilight my heart is pure...
twilight oh, i've taken my share of licks
twilight i've made it through the thin and thick
twilight but no i wasn't
twilight oh no, i wasn't
twilight no i wasn't
twilight prepared... for this!
twilight not quite. we're going to the crystal empire!
twilight are you sure? absolutely sure?
twilight king sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
twilight yes.
twilight if you think of anything, even the smallest thing...
twilight maybe the others are having better luck.
twilight c'mon, spike, we've got a crystal faire to put together!
twilight princess cadance needs our help
twilight her magic will not last forever
twilight i think we can do it
twilight but we need to work together
twilight we have to get this right
twilight yes we have to make them see
twilight we can save the crystal ponies with their history
twilight oh, we have to get this right
twilight yes we have to make them see
twilight we can save the crystal ponies with their history
twilight and the crystal kingdom anthem
twilight can you learn it in a day?
twilight oh, we have to get this right
twilight yes we have to make them see
twilight we can save the crystal ponies... with their history!
twilight it looks amazing! i don't know how i could've done this without you!fluttershy oh my. um, stop please, everyone, umm. excuse me, sir? i mean, no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. now, follow me, please. a-one, a-two, a-one two three-
fluttershy [very quietly] um... i'm fluttershy.
fluttershy [even quieter] um... my name is fluttershy.
fluttershy a baby dragon!
fluttershy oh, i've never seen a baby dragon before. he's sooo cute!
fluttershy oh my, he talks. i didn't know dragons could talk. that's just so incredibly wonderful i, i just don't even know what to say!
fluttershy wait, wait! what's his name?
fluttershy hi spike, i'm fluttershy. wow, a talking dragon! and what do dragons talk about?
fluttershy absolutely everything.
fluttershy oh, yes, please!
fluttershy poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
fluttershy ready?
fluttershy oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
fluttershy sorry girls. i'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
fluttershy [animal roar]
fluttershy wait.
fluttershy wait.
fluttershy wait!
fluttershy wait!
fluttershy shhh... it's okay. oh, you poor, poor little baby.
fluttershy now this might hurt for just a second.
fluttershy aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? yes you are, yes you are.
fluttershy i didn't. sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
fluttershy why rarity, it's so lovely.
fluttershy no. your necklace. it looks just like your cutie mark.
fluttershy angel, these are perfect.
fluttershy um, excuse me, twilight. i would just like to ask, i mean, if it would be alright, if you haven't given it to someone else--
fluttershy oh, no. i mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. you see, it's not so much the grand galloping gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. the flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of equestria. for the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! don't get me started on the fauna. there's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. white-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!
fluttershy oh, well, hello twilight. i hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
fluttershy oh, well, better late than never, right? it was angel's idea.
fluttershy oh no, i'm doing this because you're my very best friend. right angel? oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
fluttershy me too. i feel just awful that i made you feel so awful.
fluttershy now you won't get to go to the gala either.
fluttershy twilight?
fluttershy twilight, i'm so sorry, but i just wanted to mention that applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. she's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
fluttershy dizzy?
fluttershy oh applejack! thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.
fluttershy well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
fluttershy certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. they're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
fluttershy okay, little bunnies! i need you to all gather here in the middle.
fluttershy applejack! winona! stop! you're scaring them.
fluttershy oh no.
fluttershy oh my. oh... please stop, little bunnies. oh no! please, let's go home. oh my goodness.
fluttershy alright little ones, this way, this way. mama duck, you're free and clear.
fluttershy please excuse me.
fluttershy oh, um, i'm sorry. i-i-i was just trying to...
fluttershy b-b-b-but i... i...
fluttershy oh, um, well, i'll tell you later, twilight.
fluttershy um, pinkie pie, about this party for gilda. umm... do you really think it's a good idea? i meanâ
fluttershy i'm a year older than you.
fluttershy not too fast now, angel bunny. you don't wanna get a tummy ache.  you really should eat more than that, don't you think? it's not play time yet. i know you want to run, but... just three more bites. two more bites? one more bite? pretty please? 
fluttershy oh, goodness. are you okay?
fluttershy are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
fluttershy because you need some water?
fluttershy because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? i'll take that as a... yes.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy [ponies conversing in the background]
fluttershy help. help! please? help? there's-- there's a horrible cloud of smoke. it's headed this way and-- aaa!
fluttershy oh, no, pinkie pie, this is no time for celebration. this is a time for panic, for--
fluttershy there's-- there's smoke. and-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. and--
fluttershy we're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'cause ours is gonna be--
fluttershy oh, please, this is an emergency. i-i need every pony to--
fluttershy that's what i've been trying to--
fluttershy oh, thank goodness.
fluttershy a... d-dragon?
fluttershy huh?
fluttershy um, actually...
fluttershy um, let's... not? 
fluttershy m-m-mountain?
fluttershy um, excuse me, twilight? i know you're busy, but...
fluttershy but if i could just have a second...
fluttershy so, um, i was thinking that, um, maybe i should just stay here in ponyville.
fluttershy oh! good. i'll stay here and--
fluttershy i don't think i--
fluttershy i don't really think he's up to the task. maybe... but... but... 
fluttershy but... but...! 
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy it-- it's so... high!
fluttershy i-it's so... so... steep.
fluttershy oh... okay. [soft cry]
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy [soft grunts]
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy [goat bleat]
fluttershy but... it's so... wide.
fluttershy i--
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy i don't know.
fluttershy o-okay. here i go. a hop.
fluttershy skip.
fluttershy i guess i forgot to jump.
fluttershy an... an ava... ava...
fluttershy avala--!
fluttershy [collective sigh]
fluttershy sorry.
fluttershy i-- i-- i can't go in the cave.
fluttershy i'm not scared of caves, i'm scared of .
fluttershy i'm scared of .
fluttershy i'm scared of dragons!
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy yes, because they're not dragons.
fluttershy yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
fluttershy yes, because he not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
fluttershy [dragon snore]
fluttershy i was afraid to.
fluttershy i-- i-- i just... can't.
fluttershy how dare you... how dare you! listen here, mister. just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully. you may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. but you do not-- i repeat-- you do not! hurt! my! friends! you got that?
fluttershy well?
fluttershy and i am very sorry about that. but you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. you should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
fluttershy don't you 'but i' me, mister. now what do you have to say for yourself? i said, what do you have to say for yourself?
fluttershy there, there. no need to cry. you're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. now go pack your things. you just need to find a new place to sleep. that's all.
fluttershy it's okay, rainbow dash. not every pony can be as brave as me. 
fluttershy [goat bleat]
fluttershy she's mysterious.
fluttershy animals care for themselves...
fluttershy and then, she digs at the ground.
fluttershy what if she's digging for innocent creatures?
fluttershy [pinkie pie sings "evil enchantress" in the background]
fluttershy the door's open.
fluttershy ... it's a curse.
fluttershy [deep male voice] i don't want to talk about it.
fluttershy [spike snorts, then bursts out laughing]
fluttershy uh, i don't know. seems awfully dangerous.
fluttershy oopsie! sorry.
fluttershy uh... spike? are you coming?
fluttershy she's an evil enchantress
fluttershy she does evil dances
fluttershy and if you look deep in her eyes
fluttershy she'll put you in trances
fluttershy then what will she do?
fluttershy she'll mix up an evil brew
fluttershy then she'll gobble you up
fluttershy in a big tasty stew
fluttershy soooo.... watch out!
fluttershy you made me sound ridiculous!
fluttershy and the chanting?
fluttershy [normal voice] ... yes.
fluttershy [all ponies laugh]
fluttershy la, la la, la la, la la, la la. thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for princess celestia. only the prettiest ones will do. la, la la, la la, la la, la la.
fluttershy gah!
fluttershy hello little guy. i've never seen anything like you before.
fluttershy oh, are you hungry? here you go.  i guess you were hungry.
fluttershy you're the cutest thing ever. i can't wait to show you to my friends.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy twilight, pinkie, you won't believe... oh, i'm sorry. uh, am i interrupting?
fluttershy you won't believe what i found at the edge of the everfree forest. come on out, little guy. it's okay.
fluttershy three?
fluttershy i'm not sure. i'm also not sure where these other two came from.
fluttershy pinkie, do you want the other one?
fluttershy ugh?
fluttershy how could you not like...
fluttershy i've tried everything i know: i've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
fluttershy what do we do?
fluttershy ouch.
fluttershy well, i may have kept just one. heh. i couldn't help myself. they're just so cute.
fluttershy what do we do? they're eating all the food in town.
fluttershy we wake up all their sleepy heads
fluttershy so quietly and nice
fluttershy we welcome back the southern birds
fluttershy so their families can grow!
fluttershy wake up little sleepy heads. hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
fluttershy aren't they? this is my favorite task the whole season, when i get to see all my little animal friends again.
fluttershy it's like a long sleep.
fluttershy yes. [bell rings] wake up little porcupines. animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
fluttershy oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens, i'm worried that i won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
fluttershy you will? oh, that would be wonderful.
fluttershy good morning friends.
fluttershy wait. my poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
fluttershy no, you simply must wait.
fluttershy stop.
fluttershy stop.
fluttershy stop!
fluttershy no, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.
fluttershy it's... nice.
fluttershy oh, rarity. you don't have to do that. they're fine.
fluttershy hello? you wanted to see me, rarity?
fluttershy i... love it.
fluttershy no, no. i do. it's... nice.
fluttershy nice.
fluttershy oh, but i do like it.
fluttershy um... both?
fluttershy please stop asking me this, i...
fluttershy no, that's okay...
fluttershy no... it's fine...
fluttershy i... like it...
fluttershy all right! since you really wanna know...  the armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch and the overdesign is reminiscent of pret-a-porter and not true french haute couture.  but, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine.
fluttershy french haute couture, please.
fluttershy making sure we make a good appearance
fluttershy it's... perfect!
fluttershy uh... panic?
fluttershy do you like it?
fluttershy uh-uh. she doesn't like it.
fluttershy we just followed your brilliant design.
fluttershy oh, i'm so, so sorry. you okay, twilight sparkle? i just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so i decided to fly as many as i can on over to froggy bottom bog.
fluttershy bye-bye!
fluttershy of course.
fluttershy oh, i'm so sorry.
fluttershy [hydra roars]
fluttershy ah!
fluttershy [hydra head laughs]
fluttershy [ponies and spike screaming]
fluttershy a hop, skip, and a... jump!
fluttershy loss of control.
fluttershy screaming and hollering.
fluttershy passion!
fluttershy [breathes in] yay.
fluttershy yay.
fluttershy yay.
fluttershy [deep breath]  yaay.
fluttershy ...too loud?
fluttershy yay.
fluttershy wooo.
fluttershy way to go.
fluttershy rainbow dash, you rock! woohoo.  did my cheering do that?
fluttershy actually, it wasn't all bad. i particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
fluttershy were we arguing? i'm sorry.
fluttershy yay.
fluttershy she's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. i don't know if i can cheer loud enough to help her.
fluttershy now wait just a minute! oh, i'm sorry. i'm trying to be more assertive. anyhow... she is going to do a sonic rainboom!
fluttershy then show up at the cloudseum and see for yourself!.. if you're free.
fluttershy did you see that? i was so assertive!
fluttershy but rainbow dash. just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
fluttershy ... rare...
fluttershy rarity?
fluttershy it's incredible!
fluttershy uhh... c'mon girls. why don't we go see how clouds are made? don't listen to them. you're gonna win that competition for sure!
fluttershy my favorite is number ten. she just looked like such a nice pony.
fluttershy look! phase two is working. [group starts cheering again]
fluttershy oh, i can't look!
fluttershy a sonic rainboom! she did it! she did it! wooo!
fluttershy a sonic rainboom! wooo! yeah!
fluttershy it's ok.
fluttershy oh, sorry. i thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but i must have been mistaken.
fluttershy no worries, rarity. i've left her there in the basket.
fluttershy oh, no! i wouldn't! i couldn't! i-i don't really have any control over when that happens. i-it just happens. no, i'm just good with animals. it's my special gift, you know?
fluttershy these are lovely, but twenty by tonight? how will you get it all done?
fluttershy well, maybe i should get out of your mane so you can work.
fluttershy what does that patch on your cape mean?
fluttershy i, ah, i suppose i could take them for the night.
fluttershy oh, it's no problem at all.
fluttershy did i have a problem with opal? you've seen how well i handle small creatures!
fluttershy come on, it'll be fun.
fluttershy these sweet little angels?
fluttershy so cute. w-wait for me!
fluttershy oh, won't this be ever so fun. we can have a nice little tea party, and braid each other's tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and--
fluttershy [rush of air, clattering hooves]
fluttershy oh! hello, twilight. where are you off to?
fluttershy th-the everfree forest? ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
fluttershy rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so i volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
fluttershy what? these sweet little angels? they'll be no problem at all.
fluttershy [crickets chirping quietly, owl hooting]
fluttershy [door closes]
fluttershy [to herself] no problem at all.  okay, girls, uh, what should we do?
fluttershy girls?
fluttershy should we--
fluttershy girls, okay, now settle --
fluttershy i-i know you're excited, but-- girls, oh, oh, careful with the-- oh, ah, girls--
fluttershy [fluttershy moves her mane off her face with a puff]
fluttershy so! what do you wanna do? play a game?
fluttershy mmm, i don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?
fluttershy oh, no. the everfree forest is much too dangerous. it's filled with far too many strange creatures.
fluttershy um, oh, maybe that's not such a-- now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring. dhh--
fluttershy careful... you don't...
fluttershy ...break anything.
fluttershy oh, girls, it's okay. i--
fluttershy c-carpenters?
fluttershy well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
fluttershy it's called "shhh!"
fluttershy well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. sound fun? i'm the world champ, you know. i bet you can't beat me!  [draws a deep breath]
fluttershy no!
fluttershy i mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
fluttershy um, okay, um. maybe the crusading can wait until morning? when it's light? and not so... dark?
fluttershy [blows out candle] maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
fluttershy how about i sing you a lullaby?
fluttershy [clears throat]
fluttershy hush now, quiet now
fluttershy it's time to lay your sleepy head
fluttershy hush now, quiet now
fluttershy it's time to go to bed
fluttershy oh, how wonderful! why don't you sing it with me?
fluttershy okay sweetie, that was...
fluttershy thank you sweetie, um...
fluttershy okay, sweetie, that was...
fluttershy thank you, sweetie, um...
fluttershy [chickens clucking and flapping]
fluttershy girls!
fluttershy no, i don't think that's a-- ah, come back! please!
fluttershy [cutie mark crusaders giggling, more chicken flapping and squawking]
fluttershy come on, girls, the chickens are fine-- oh, girls, um... girls!
fluttershy [chickens flapping and clucking]
fluttershy come on, in you go.
fluttershy [eerie music]
fluttershy there's some good chickens. okay, you three. isn't it about time you got into bed?
fluttershy please?
fluttershy so, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
fluttershy okay, good night.
fluttershy it really wasn't that hard ... i mean, all i needed to do was just show them who's in charge. nothing's gonna get past fluttershy! good with animals, good with kids.
fluttershy [quiet galloping]
fluttershy [tearing fabric]
fluttershy mmm, peace and quiet.  too quiet.  girls? girls? elizabeak! she's missing! girls?  oh, no! they must have gone looking for my missing chicken! which means... they must have gone into...   the everfree forest!
fluttershy those girls have really done it this time! they've really bitten off more than they can chew! oh, just like me! i never should have offered to watch them. [draws a deep breath]
fluttershy (whispering) girls?  girls? [tiny terrified squeak] oh! get a hold of yourself, fluttershy. just put one hoof in front of the other.
fluttershy [twig snaps]
fluttershy ahh! what was that?
fluttershy [rush of air, clattering hooves]
fluttershy twilight? i-is that you? oh, twilight, it is you. thank goodness you're here. i need your help. the girls are out here somewhere, and i'm afraid that they're--  oh! what's happened to you? 
fluttershy [twilight falls over]
fluttershy oh, no! if you've been turned to stone, it must mean-- oh! oh no, the girls! don't move; i'll be back for you. girls!
fluttershy girls? girls?
fluttershy girls? thank goodness i found you!
fluttershy girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
fluttershy there's no time for that. there's a cockatrice on the loose!
fluttershy a cockatrice! it's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. now, come on!
fluttershy no! never look one in the eye. if you look a cockatrice in the eye--
fluttershy [brush rustling, a chicken cluck]
fluttershy girls! wait!
fluttershy see? now we have to --
fluttershy girls, please. girls-- now listen to me, girls, i-- please!
fluttershy [cockatrice squawking]
fluttershy girls! behind me, now!
fluttershy [cockatrice squawking and roaring]
fluttershy you! just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
fluttershy you should be ashamed of yourself. i have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. now you go over there, and turn elizabeak and my friend twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. do you understand me?
fluttershy are you girls all right? i was so worried!
fluttershy oh, you do, do you? well, you better, or i'll give you... the stare.
fluttershy and that's when it brought you back from stone.
fluttershy oh, i wouldn't go that far.
fluttershy i assumed that i'd be just as good with kids as i am with animals. boy, was i wrong. i really learned the hard way not to bite off more than i could chew.
fluttershy did you finish all those capes?
fluttershy won't you stay for some tea?
fluttershy allow me. [clears throat] girls?
fluttershy go and get your things. rarity is here to see you home.
fluttershy i guess i'm just as good with kids as i am with animals.
fluttershy of course. how about later today?
fluttershy [opal yowls]
fluttershy [closing credits]
fluttershy oh! oh my. oh, oh!
fluttershy but they blocked up all the holes.
fluttershy oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere. oh, poor rarity must be terrified.
fluttershy oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
fluttershy is everything all right?
fluttershy photo finish?
fluttershy what a lovely compliment.
fluttershy that's wonderful.
fluttershy oh, rarity, i'm so happy for you.
fluttershy oh, goodness. i don't know.
fluttershy i'm flattered, really.
fluttershy but...
fluttershy there has to be somepony more quali...
fluttershy somepony more into fashion.
fluttershy somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
fluttershy oh, if it's that important to you, of course i'll do it.
fluttershy what a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
fluttershy a-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
fluttershy i'm so sorry. i tried my best.
fluttershy oh, rarity. i was so worried i'd ruined everything.
fluttershy oh, i am so excited for you. just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of equestria.
fluttershy i can't, rarity.
fluttershy n... nervous.
fluttershy you can't let rarity down. you must do this. you must. you must. you must.
fluttershy oh, yes. best time ever...
fluttershy i'll see you at the spa. our usual time?
fluttershy photo finish?
fluttershy um... photo finish?
fluttershy photo finish, i'm so sorry to interrupt. it's just that i'm running late.
fluttershy oh, actually i'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
fluttershy rarity! i'm so sorry i'm... oh no. she's already gone, isn't she?
fluttershy oh, i can't believe this. i am so frustrated i could just scream. 
fluttershy no. can i tell you something?
fluttershy you promise not to tell rarity?
fluttershy pinkie pie-swear?
fluttershy i don't like being a model. no, i hate being a model. all this attention is awful, just awful. and i'm only doing it because rarity told me i must. i must! i must!  i must...
fluttershy oh, what were you about to say?
fluttershy oh, no. i could never do such a thing. rarity would be devastated.
fluttershy oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. photo finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. she'd find somepony else with... the magic!
fluttershy you really think it'll work?
fluttershy this is awful. just awful! somehow i've become more popular than ever. oh, i'm so frustrated i could just kick something!
fluttershy [kicks a vase, vase wobbles]
fluttershy if only rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
fluttershy i'm great! i'm a super famous fashion model. why wouldn't i be great?
fluttershy you did?!
fluttershy love? oh, rarity. i hate being a model.
fluttershy more than anything.
fluttershy i was afraid if i quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over equestria".
fluttershy never!
fluttershy if we just told each other the truth.
fluttershy me too.
fluttershy cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
fluttershy i'm sorry, photo finish, but i don't think i'll be able to make any of them.
fluttershy we go!
fluttershy now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
fluttershy awwww!
fluttershy i'd like to be a tree...
fluttershy huffy the magic dragon!
fluttershy a stampede of buffalo.
fluttershy and we can't find pinkie pie.
fluttershy but why?
fluttershy pinkie! we're so glad you're safe.
fluttershy [indistinct "oh, there you are!" "thank goodness!"]
fluttershy there you go, mr. mousey. now you stay off that leg and do everything i told you. and it will be just like new in no time at all.
fluttershy oh, you're welcome. happy to be able to help.
fluttershy you... found a watch? you... wanna be a watch? you're running! running out of time? no. you're... late?
fluttershy [a clock strikes four]
fluttershy i'm late for a very important date! the big brunch for princess celestia at sugarcube corner. oh, the princess is here in ponyville for a party and we all promised we'd be there. but i'm not there! oh, do i look all right? do i need to bring anything? maybe i shouldn't go?
fluttershy aah! it's starting! i'm missing it! [departs, then returns] oh, thanks, angel. [and again] i mean, if if you hadn't reminded me, i might have not remembered and then... then i wouldn't be there and everypony would be wondering where i was and... oh, right. i'm late.
fluttershy oh, okay then. see you later.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy phew. made it.
fluttershy no one. never mind. i'll go home.
fluttershy thanks, twilight.
fluttershy sorry i'm late. i had to finish taking care of a patient first.
fluttershy wow, twilight. i thought i was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
fluttershy but she's met us all before.
fluttershy well, i'm sure you have nothing to worry about. besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
fluttershy or... perhaps not that casual.
fluttershy it's okay, twilight. so our friends' manners aren't perfect. i doubt the princess will even notice.
fluttershy me? oh yes, your highness.
fluttershy yes, i love to take care of animals.
fluttershy oh... my.
fluttershy i... i... i've never seen anything like it.
fluttershy oh, you poor little thing. how did you ever get in such bad condition? don't you worry, philomena. i'll nurse you back to health. as a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly. i'm sure the princess will appreciate the help.
fluttershy oh my. we'd better get you to bed right away.
fluttershy there.
fluttershy this is far worse than i thought. what you need is some medicine. stat!
fluttershy here you go, philomena. this will fix you right up.
fluttershy doctor fluttershy expected that.
fluttershy always works.
fluttershy uh... almost always.
fluttershy there's nothing like home-made soup
fluttershy to cure what ails you.
fluttershy come on now. you'd not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.
fluttershy mmm... see? it's delicious. good and good for you. here come the choo-choo train. chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
fluttershy oh dear.
fluttershy don't worry, philomena. i know what'll make you feel better. wait right here. i have just the thing.
fluttershy look, philomena. i brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. didn't you, boy? say hello to your new friend philomena.
fluttershy aw, look. i think he likes you.
fluttershy your turn now, philomena. go ahead. you can do it.
fluttershy um... good try?
fluttershy i know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. a humidifier. [deep breath] refreshing. how's that feeling now for you, philomena? better?
fluttershy oh... that's okay. i know lots of other ways to take care of you. don't worry. you're gonna get better. how about...
fluttershy aromatherapy?
fluttershy warm bath?
fluttershy ointment?
fluttershy scalpel. surgical tape. feathers.
fluttershy oh, philomena. i thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. i've tried everything i know. and look at you. you're worse than ever.
fluttershy i couldn't leave the poor thing there. she needed my help.
fluttershy how could i just walk away and not do anything?
fluttershy i had to do something.
fluttershy but...
fluttershy but...
fluttershy you're right. okay, let's...
fluttershy ...go.
fluttershy [excessive coughing]
fluttershy but it's daytime.
fluttershy going to return philomena, remember?
fluttershy why not?
fluttershy do you?
fluttershy you really think the princess would do that?
fluttershy all that really matters to me is that poor little philomena here gets well.
fluttershy please, twilight. you just have to help me get philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. and everything will be fine.
fluttershy i tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
fluttershy she can't fly.
fluttershy uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. the ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, i mean.
fluttershy i don't think she likes it.
fluttershy of course, but...
fluttershy well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but i can't get her to stay put.
fluttershy it's for your own good, philomena, i promise. please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
fluttershy i made it for philomena. but she wouldn't eat it.
fluttershy no! philomena! come back!
fluttershy excuse me!
fluttershy philomena, come down from there! you'll hurt yourself!
fluttershy i'll catch you!
fluttershy [cries/whimpers]
fluttershy it's all my fault.
fluttershy i'm the one who did it.
fluttershy some help i was.
fluttershy but it's my fault!
fluttershy thanks for trying to protect me, twilight, but... princess celestia, i'm the one who took your pet bird. i really was only trying to help the poor little thing. then i was gonna bring it back to you, honest. so, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what i deserve.
fluttershy i don't understand! what is that thing? what happened to philomena?
fluttershy a... a phoenix?
fluttershy so... aren't you gonna banish me? or throw me in a dungeon? or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
fluttershy i guess i have some imagination.
fluttershy i know. i shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. next time i'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
fluttershy it's beautiful. thank you, philomena. no hard feelings.
fluttershy all right, little ones. this way. this way. you really should be more careful. somepony could get hurt. why are you in such a hurry anyway?
fluttershy oh, that would be interesting. you know, i wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
fluttershy oh yes. it all started at summer flight camp.
fluttershy you'd never guess, but when i was little i was very shy. and a very weak flyer.
fluttershy it was the most humiliating moment of my life. and then, out of nowhere...
fluttershy i had never seen such beautiful creatures. butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. and i've never been near the ground before.
fluttershy what is this place
fluttershy filled with so many wonders?
fluttershy casting its spell
fluttershy that i am now under
fluttershy squirrels in the trees
fluttershy and the cute little bunnies
fluttershy birds flying free
fluttershy and bees with their honey
fluttershy hooneeeeey!
fluttershy oooh, what a magical place
fluttershy and i owe it all to the pegasus race
fluttershy if i knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
fluttershy i'd have come here sooner, and never leave
fluttershy yes, i love everythiiiiiiiiiiiing!
fluttershy somehow i had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
fluttershy oh. well, i wasn't there, so i don't really know what happened.
fluttershy bye, girls!
fluttershy wait a second. i heard that explosion. and i saw the rainbow too. rainbow dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, i never would have learned i could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
fluttershy do you realize what this means? all of us had a special connection before we even met.
fluttershy i'm so glad we're friends!
fluttershy hey. how about a song?
fluttershy he's just wonderful.
fluttershy maybe spike feels threatened or worried that owlowiscious will replace him?
fluttershy you always throw the best parties, pinkie pie.
fluttershy itâs been lovely.
fluttershy as inâ¦?
fluttershy itâsâ¦ uhâ¦ a big house.
fluttershy heâsâ¦ a bear.
fluttershy itâs, uh, really more of a cave.
fluttershy and, uh, he wants us to look after his houseâ¦ uh, caveâ¦ while heâs, uhâ¦
fluttershy [over rainbow dash] collect sea shells! ...play beach volleyball! ...collect volleyballs!
fluttershy not since this morning.
fluttershy iâm just glad i was able to come up with an excuse for why i couldnât be there.
fluttershy as long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
fluttershy [in unison] surprise!
fluttershy i really thought sheâd be more excited.
fluttershy donât worry about it.
fluttershy oh, definitely.
fluttershy yes. will they be safe, twilight?
fluttershy opalescence, no!
fluttershy at the gala, in the garden
fluttershy i'm going to see them all!
fluttershy all the creatures, i'll befriend them at the gala! (at the gala!)
fluttershy all the birdies, and the critters
fluttershy they will love me big and small!
fluttershy we'll become good friends forever
fluttershy right here at the gala!
fluttershy meet new friends
fluttershy to meet!
fluttershy oh my! a meadowlark!
fluttershy i think she's calling to me. it's exactly what i wished for! 
fluttershy my little meadowlark is right around this bend!
fluttershy was that you?
fluttershy oh! yes... well... excuse me.
fluttershy [animal noises]
fluttershy oh! i see a toco toucan! and a spider monkey! and, oh! is that a wallaroo?
fluttershy oh, fluttershy. you're such a loudmouth.
fluttershy this isn't what i wished for.
fluttershy ...for this moment.
fluttershy i just have to be more bold, like twilight says.  i'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! but i'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
fluttershy [sound of crunching]
fluttershy gotcha! it's okay. i promise not to hurt you. i just wanna be your... friend?
fluttershy come out!
fluttershy i'll catch you yet, my pretties. oh yes. as soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be mine! mine!!! [scariest laughter you'll ever hear] whoa!
fluttershy you're... going to love me!
fluttershy talking!
fluttershy now, angel, you really shouldn'tâ no! it's not possible! i must be seeing things!
fluttershy oh dear. i hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. i'd hate to have to share them.
fluttershy can we go home now?
fluttershy w-we have to go in there?
fluttershy what's that? who's there? girls!
fluttershy okay, i can do this. i can...   oh, wait a minute... butterflies? wait! don't leave me here!
fluttershy oh, no. i'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
fluttershy not at all. i am weak and helpless and i appreciate their understanding.
fluttershy not really. in fact, i think i'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best i can be.
fluttershy aw, boo hoo hoo! [twilight is shocked] why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
fluttershy oh, that's right, you can't. you don't have one.
fluttershy [fluttershy whips her tail in twilight's face]
fluttershy oh, yeah? well ha, ha.
fluttershy no. ha, ha.
fluttershy no. ha ha-ha ha ha.
fluttershy ha, ha.
fluttershy i'm touching your gem, rarity. ha, ha.
fluttershy good boy, angel. mama's so proud.
fluttershy don't worry, you won't. 
fluttershy with pleasure.
fluttershy 'cause you just looked so peaceful.
fluttershy hey, twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
fluttershy your face! 
fluttershy hah!
fluttershy [sing-song voice] keep away!
fluttershy hmph! garbage.
fluttershy oops, sorry, rainbow crash. 
fluttershy yeah! i'm sick of you losers.
fluttershy oh no! twilight, applejack, i just had the worst dream!
fluttershy uh? she's not here.
fluttershy got it!
fluttershy um...i'm just wondering if it's okay if i hold you down against your will for a little bit?
fluttershy [whimper/crying] i can't!
fluttershy that big...dumb...meanie!
fluttershy [assorted grunts]
fluttershy [continued assorted grunts]
fluttershy you really should have come to me sooner. you were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
fluttershy [various shock statements]
fluttershy yes?
fluttershy yes?
fluttershy yes?
fluttershy [sighs of relief]
fluttershy oh thank goodness. i thought something really awful had happened.
fluttershy wow. i've never seen twilight so upset before.
fluttershy why would you enchant your doll?
fluttershy magic kindergarten?
fluttershy please, your highness. we all saw that twilight was upset...
fluttershy please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
fluttershy mmhmm.
fluttershy [all right, etc]
fluttershy we learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
fluttershy go away! no candy here! visitors not welcome on nightmare night!
fluttershy it is you. oh, and nightmare moon.  nightmare moon?!
fluttershy likewise.
fluttershy okay.
fluttershy okay.
fluttershy okay.
fluttershy perfectlessonover.
fluttershy [nervous, dazed laughter] yes.
fluttershy i thought you knew. you didn't know? she didn't know?
fluttershy oh, please don't be mad at us.
fluttershy ohh! y, y, oh, really? you really want a pet? really? 'cause i've got so many wonderful choices at my house. oh, and i know you'll just love them, and they'll love you, oh! and you'll be best friends forever and ever! oh!
fluttershy now, rainbow, my dear, i cannot express my delight
fluttershy it's abundantly clear
fluttershy that somewhere out here
fluttershy is the pet that will suit you just right
fluttershy awesome, cool, got it!
fluttershy i have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see
fluttershy sure! how 'bout a bunny?
fluttershy they're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
fluttershy rainbow, have faith
fluttershy you see, i will bet you
fluttershy somewhere in here is the pet that will get you
fluttershy come on, the sky's the limit!
fluttershy really? because i think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. yes, he does. aww, look, he likes you!
fluttershy i have so many wonderful choices for you to decide
fluttershy there are otters and seals
fluttershy with massive appeal
fluttershy maybe not, but i've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
fluttershy wait! there must be a pet here
fluttershy that will fit the ticket
fluttershy how 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?
fluttershy bigger, cooler. right.
fluttershy i've got just the thing in that tree, dash
fluttershy meet your new fabulous pet, squirrely
fluttershy not just any squirrel. a flying squirrel!
fluttershy i'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
fluttershy i have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky
fluttershy like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
fluttershy i see. how 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?
fluttershy there's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that
fluttershy there are falcons and eagles
fluttershy they are both quite regal
fluttershy or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?
fluttershy not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.
fluttershy no.
fluttershy i've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you
fluttershy don't forget style, that should be considered
fluttershy the one who is awesome as cool
fluttershy so a contest we will see
fluttershy in the world for me
fluttershy may the games
fluttershy begin
fluttershy now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and-
fluttershy technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. he just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. you won't even know he's here.
fluttershy oh, just let him try.
fluttershy it won't hurt to let him try.
fluttershy just let him try?
fluttershy tortoise.
fluttershy where's rainbow dash?
fluttershy it's the turtle!
fluttershy ...whatever...
fluttershy maybe we'd better go meet him half way.
fluttershy rainbow! your new pet is over here waiting for you!
fluttershy the best of the best like you wanted, remember? it can fly and it's not a squirrel! should we sing about it again?
fluttershy yay?
fluttershy but rainbow! you didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
fluttershy she really cares about everypony's safety.
fluttershy ooh, ooh! and i did the flyby afterwards.
fluttershy oh, poor opal, where is the sick darling?
fluttershy poor baby.
fluttershy she looks awful.
fluttershy happy birthday, spike.
fluttershy i'm up here!
fluttershy i was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
fluttershy spike? but why would spike steal my chicken coop? he just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
fluttershy don't worry rarity, we'll save you!
fluttershy i- if you wouldn't mind, that is...
fluttershy we'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
fluttershy we did it! i can't believe we did it!
fluttershy i'm so excited, i-i feel like shouting!  woo hoo!
fluttershy oh, i wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... i can't go onstage! i don't want everypony looking at me!
fluttershy no?
fluttershy so you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
fluttershy a lot?
fluttershy hundreds?
fluttershy [wind rushing]
fluttershy oh! commander hurricane, sir! how did it go, sir?
fluttershy conquer, sir?
fluttershy i don't see any enemies, commander. just... snow.
fluttershy what a view... i can see my future house from here.
fluttershy i vote for calm.
fluttershy [windigo roaring]
fluttershy what is that... thing?
fluttershy windigos?
fluttershy well, i don't hate you... i actually hate commander hurricane a lot more than i hate you guys.
fluttershy actually, i don't really hate her, i just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
fluttershy what was that?
fluttershy oh, i would love to babysit! but i can't today, sorry. i promised angel we'd go on a picnic. you understand, don't you? y-you're not mad at me are you? please don't be mad at me!
fluttershy oh, i hope applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
fluttershy i know, but i hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling.
fluttershy oh, pinkie, you startled me.
fluttershy maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
fluttershy i don't know how we'll break it to the apple family.
fluttershy we're so glad you're safe!
fluttershy are you okay?
fluttershy um, excuse me?
fluttershy ooh... can you please slow down?
fluttershy help!
fluttershy stop!
fluttershy nn-nn.
fluttershy applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. but if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
fluttershy who could that be? it's still dark!
fluttershy oh, where are we? what's the rush?
fluttershy um, well, uh-
fluttershy i guess i-
fluttershy gee rainbow dash. it looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
fluttershy [zipping noise]
fluttershy oh, gosh pinkie. i love your new style.
fluttershy for the record, i don't mind-
fluttershy uh, pinkie pie-
fluttershy got it.
fluttershy oh, i'm so worried!
fluttershy it's not so bad rainbow dash.
fluttershy hi rainbow dash!
fluttershy we thought we'd come and cheer you up!
fluttershy we know how much you like to win!
fluttershy um... sky five?
fluttershy but rainbow dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
fluttershy glad we could... cheer you up?
fluttershy lunch time! who's hungry? plenty for everypony. slow down, sweetie. 
fluttershy here you go, angel bunny.
fluttershy okay, mister picky-pants, you win. carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum! what? but- then, what will you eat? i'm not sure i can even make that. well... i don't want you to starve... oh, are you sure i can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of-  i'll make your special recipe.
fluttershy [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
fluttershy hmm, let's see. asparagus. excuse me... umm... i think you just stepped in front of me...? excuse me, i think you made a mistake? you see i was actually here first and-
fluttershy i know.
fluttershy oh, pardon me, sir-
fluttershy i think you just cut in front of me.
fluttershy i said [into ear trumpet] i think you just cut in front of me.
fluttershy i noticed.
fluttershy hey!
fluttershy but-
fluttershy oh, okay. there's no rush.
fluttershy oh, it-it's really no big deal...
fluttershy what problem? oh, go right ahead pinkie pie, you first.
fluttershy a doormat?
fluttershy oh, okay. i promise. oh! good!
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy oh, that's okay, i don't mind.
fluttershy ...um... i guess not.
fluttershy let's see... i also need tomatoes.
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy here you go.
fluttershy oh, but last week it was only one bit.
fluttershy oh, okay. i don't wanna argue about it.
fluttershy i guess you're right!
fluttershy um... okay. [to self] i need that cherry. [to cherry stallholder] boy am i glad you have one cherry left. you see i'm making this special meal for my bunny angel, he's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
fluttershy [bit clinking]
fluttershy here you go.
fluttershy oh, yes, i'm desperate for it!
fluttershy ten?! oh, hey, mister handsome, i know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
fluttershy ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! i insist on paying you... eleven bits!
fluttershy umm...i mean, nine bits!
fluttershy okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
fluttershy it's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
fluttershy but... i was only doing what you did.
fluttershy but... i can't let angel starve! he won't eat it unless i make it just right! i need that cherry no matter what it costs!
fluttershy twenty?! oh, but, i don't have that much!
fluttershy tada! here you go, angel. sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. angel?  look at me... i really am a doormat. [reading from pamphlet] the incredible iron will turns doormats into dynamos. assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre. as celestia is my witness, i'm never gonna be a pushover again!
fluttershy [ponies chattering]
fluttershy oh! ah! uh... excuse me! 
fluttershy [music playing on eye of the tiger starts]
fluttershy [goats bleat]
fluttershy [fireworks explode]
fluttershy [ponies cheering]
fluttershy who, me?
fluttershy uh, well...
fluttershy okay.
fluttershy um, politely walk around him?
fluttershy gingerly tip-toe around him?
fluttershy go back home and try again tomorrow?
fluttershy oh! sorry.
fluttershy uh... next time, get out of the way before... i bump into you, 'cause... i totally wonât be sorry when i do!
fluttershy okay, i feel good. i feel ready to âattack the dayâ, as iron will says.
fluttershy [water spraying]
fluttershy excuse me, mr. greenhooves, but i-i think you might be over-watering my petunias...
fluttershy ...again...
fluttershy âtreat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over.â
fluttershy thank you. [excited giggle] i can't believe it worked!
fluttershy [clears throat] excuse me? would you mind moving your carts so i can pass?
fluttershy a-hemmmm, can you move, you're blocking my path.
fluttershy âwhen somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!â
fluttershy good!
fluttershy what do you think you're doing?! didn't you see me?
fluttershy 'maybe'? âmaybes are for babies!â  now go to the back of the line where you belong!
fluttershy [vcr rewind sound]
fluttershy iron will's not a monster, he's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. his techniques really work.
fluttershy yes i am. and new fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new fluttershy.
fluttershy âyou laugh at me, i wrath at you!â
fluttershy bye, girls.
fluttershy [ponies running away]
fluttershy what a day. taxi! oh no you don't. âcut in line, i'll take what's mine!â
fluttershy [fight sounds]
fluttershy nopony pushes new fluttershy around!  nopony!
fluttershy you got this, new fluttershy! this day is yours! and nopony's gonna take it away from you! am i right?! right! what?! he's delivered the wrong mail, again!
fluttershy and new fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
fluttershy âyou apologize, i penalize!"
fluttershy [mail cart zooms in and out]
fluttershy sure, you just- 
fluttershy âyou make me lose, i blow my fuse!â
fluttershy didn't you see what he did to new fluttershy? and he thought new fluttershy was a pushover!
fluttershy what?! you just want new fluttershy to be a doormat like old fluttershy! but old fluttershy is gone!
fluttershy no, you want wimp fluttershy. you want pushover fluttershy. you want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain fluttershy!
fluttershy things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, pinkie pie?
fluttershy why not? i thought 'petty' was what you're all about, rarity. with your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
fluttershy oh, and what are you passionate about? birthday cake? party hats? i can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in ponyville are trying to tell new fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
fluttershy iron will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!  ...i'm the monster.
fluttershy [wind blows]
fluttershy [wolf howls]
fluttershy go away! go away before nasty fluttershy strikes again!
fluttershy pinkie's right. i'm the only one to blame.  but don't worry, i'm never coming out of my house again. everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
fluttershy i, i'm not sure i can, i'm too far gone. whenever i try to assert myself i become a monster.
fluttershy [lightning strikes]
fluttershy um, no.
fluttershy [goat bleats]
fluttershy no.
fluttershy as i recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. well, i'm not satisfied.
fluttershy well i guess i'm the first then. but since i'm not satisfied, i refuse to pay. it's as simple as that.
fluttershy [goats bleating]
fluttershy i'm sorry, but no means no.
fluttershy don't worry, old fluttershy's back for good. i'm sorry i took the whole assertiveness thing too far. friends?
fluttershy dear princess celestia, sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when i first tried it, i didn't like the pony i became. but i've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. now i know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant, or mean.
fluttershy happy to... help... but... can i carry... the balloons next time?
fluttershy oh!
fluttershy [horn blowing]
fluttershy who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
fluttershy aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. right, cerberus? who's a good boy? who's a good boy?
fluttershy there's nothing fun about dragons! scary, yes. fun, no.
fluttershy now that you put it that way, yes!
fluttershy miss out on what? dragons? big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
fluttershy thanks, but... no thanks!
fluttershy i said... no!
fluttershy [high pitched growling] 
fluttershy achoo. hi, rainbow dash. [coughs weakly]
fluttershy oh, i  i think i have [coughs weakly] the pony pox. i'm sorry, i really, really wanted to come to training day today [coughs weakly] but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop. achoo. [coughs weakly]
fluttershy i know, plenty of bed-
fluttershy oh, y'know, all of a sudden i'm, i'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] i'll just get out of these robes and- ow! oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt, i guess i can't fly after all-
fluttershy well, y'see, uh, well, oh, rainbow dash, i just can't do it! i can't fly!
fluttershy but that was different, that was an emergency! this whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how i hate performing in front of others. don't you remember flight camp? i couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
fluttershy you're right, rainbow dash, it wasn't bad. it was horrible!
fluttershy the other foals used to tease me, a lot!
fluttershy i just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
fluttershy oh, i-i don't think so, rainbow dash...
fluttershy wait. i'll do it.
fluttershy i will.
fluttershy i'm game.
fluttershy [takes deep breath]
fluttershy yes!
fluttershy i'm sorry, rainbow dash, i just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now...
fluttershy [squirrel chittering]
fluttershy oh, thank you, but i'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
fluttershy [duck quacking]
fluttershy i tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
fluttershy [birds chirp]
fluttershy i know it's important to have confidence in myself...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy yes, yes, i do remember. the river was swelling...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy ...and you were scared...
fluttershy [badger squeaking]
fluttershy ...yes, i did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. you're right, my friends. i shouldn't give up. i will get my confidence up and show everypony that i am a good flyer! a great flyer!
fluttershy [animal noises]
fluttershy [training montage music begins]
fluttershy 2.3. 2.3?! that has to be some kind of mistake! i worked so hard!
fluttershy no i didn't. i thought i'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! there's no way i'll fly with 10.0 wing power by tomorrow!
fluttershy how would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
fluttershy exactly! humiliated! [between sobs] i'm sorry, rainbow dash, i just can't do it!
fluttershy twilight!
fluttershy i figured... if i couldn't help rainbow dash with the tornado... the least i could do was offer moral support!
fluttershy oh no! that's terrible news!
fluttershy [water splashing]
fluttershy oh, i'm too nervous to look!
fluttershy i won't make a difference!
fluttershy my measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
fluttershy no!
fluttershy whuh, what? did we do it?
fluttershy ah!
fluttershy dear princess celestia, sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, i learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. if you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.
fluttershy [cloudsdale chugging]
fluttershy [bell rings]
fluttershy [foals chattering]
fluttershy [muffled crying]
fluttershy oh my.
fluttershy so did i.
fluttershy so tasty.
fluttershy and it was so good.
fluttershy but i'm really really sorry.
fluttershy oh my goodness! what an honor!
fluttershy um, twilight? are you okay?
fluttershy she did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
fluttershy but... he was singing really off-key.
fluttershy [bird sings off-key]
fluttershy can you believe it? we're gonna be princess mi amore cadenza's new bridesmaids!
fluttershy [excited chatter]
fluttershy oh goodness! are you okay?
fluttershy rarity!
fluttershy oh, um. excuse me! oh! hello! i was just wondering. oh, oh that's okay. you all look really busy.
fluttershy they had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
fluttershy oh, we have to get this right
fluttershy yes we have to make them see
fluttershy we can save the crystal ponies with their history
fluttershy oh, we have to get this right
fluttershy yes we have to make them see
fluttershy we can save the crystal ponies... with their history!rarity no, no, no, oh! goodness no.
rarity just a moment, please! i'm 'in the zone', as it were. oh, yes! sparkle always does the trick, does it not? why, rarity, you are a talent. now, um, how can i help yo-  oh my stars, darling! whatever happened to your coiffure?!
rarity out of my hair? what about your hair?!
rarity no, no, uh-uh. too green. too yellow. too poofy. not poofy enough. too frilly. too... shiny. now go on, my dear. you were telling me where you're from.
rarity huh?
rarity canterlot?! oh, i am so envious! the glamor, the sophistication! i have always dreamed of living there! i can't wait to hear all about it! we are gonna be the best of friends, you and i... emeralds?! what was i thinking? let me get you some rubies!
rarity huh?
rarity [ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]
rarity she's gone!
rarity [ponies gasping]
rarity she's gone.
rarity ugh, heavens no! just look at it - it's dreadful.
rarity take that, you ruffian!
rarity my hair! woop--
rarity eugh. my eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. well, i didn't mean that literally.
rarity i didn't see you there, my apologies.
rarity she is.
rarity why, of course it is. how can you be so insensitive? oh, just look at him. such lovely luminescent scales.
rarity and your expertly coiffed mane.
rarity your fabulous manicure.
rarity all ruined without your beautiful mustache.
rarity i simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
rarity you look smashing.
rarity oh. it's fine, my dear. short tails are in this season. besides, it'll grow back.
rarity look!
rarity oh, thank goodness.
rarity i know! i'll never part with it again.
rarity what? ooh. so does yours.
rarity are these what i think they are?
rarity the gala? i design ensembles for the gala every year, but i've never had the opportunity to attend. oh, the society, the culture, the glamor! it's where i truly belong, and where i'm destined to meet him.
rarity him. i would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, "who is that mysterious mare?" they would never guess that i was just a simple pony from little old ponyville. why, i would cause such a sensation that i would be invited for an audience with princess celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in canterlot. our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. our courtship would be magnificent. he would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course i would say,"yes!" we would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is  what i would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.
rarity twilight, i simply cannot believe you would invite pinkie pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. how could you? hmph.
rarity you haven't?
rarity you? you want to go to the gala?
rarity but twilight-
rarity twilight, it's raining.
rarity come with me before you catch a cold.
rarity oh no, it's quite alright. after all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? and you know what the best of friends do?
rarity makeovers!
rarity there. oh, you're simply darling.
rarity and you. oh spike, i have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
rarity now you just need a hat.
rarity oh, who needs him anyway. this is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the grand galloping gala.
rarity and oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. i happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a t. we would be the belles of the ball, you and i. everyone would be clamoring for our attention. all eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of equestria is rarity the unicorn. ah, [nervous laughter] and twilight sparkle, of course.
rarity twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as i did.
rarity allow us to treat you to dinner.
rarity but mayor, whatever shall we do?
rarity just one last thing. now we're ready.
rarity messy? well, did you see her mane?
rarity ooo. 
rarity i hear she's an old friend of rainbow dash. a griffon, so rare.
rarity oh, my favorite game. can i go first? can i have the purple tail?
rarity my, my, my! what boasting!
rarity just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
rarity just who does she think she is?
rarity enough. enough, all of you. i take your hint, but rarity is above such nonsense. rainbow dash and applejack may behave like ruffians, but rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
rarity oh, it. is. on! you may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. a unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. a unicorn needs to have style.
rarity a unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
rarity quick! i need a mirror! get me a mirror! what did she do to my hair? i know she did something terrible to my hair!
rarity ugh, no. green hair! not green hair!  such an awful, awful color! 
rarity hate you?
rarity why, whatever do you mean, darling?
rarity most unpleasant.
rarity mm-hmm.
rarity huh?
rarity well, at least he's not snoring fire. what are we meant to do about it?
rarity hmph. talk about getting your beauty sleep.
rarity ewww! much better. onward!
rarity good thing i brought my scarf.
rarity i hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. ooo, if i play my cards right, i might be able to convince him to part with a few!
rarity ugh. that's thirty-five games in a row. best of seventy-one?
rarity almost there.
rarity eugh. bu-la-la-la-la.
rarity uh! this is why a girl always packs extra accessories. oh, please tell me i brought the tiara that goes with this.
rarity my apologies.
rarity obviously, this situation just calls for a little "pony charm". allow me, girls. i'm so sorry to interrupt. [clears throat] but i couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. and those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?
rarity personally, i think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. hmm. obviously, i would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
rarity i was this close to getting that diamond.
rarity oh, yeah... sure.
rarity darling, you look ridiculous.
rarity hmm. hah! perfect.
rarity somepony has to. you were making an absolute mess of the town square, applejack.
rarity i simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
rarity oh no! my wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
rarity oh! ah! oh ph!! it's coming down too fast! ah! oh! oh! ah! help me!
rarity oh, no, no, no!
rarity i prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
rarity well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
rarity that doesn't even make any sense.
rarity does not.
rarity does not.
rarity does not.
rarity does not infinity plus one. heh. what say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
rarity on the contrary, i believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
rarity nor am i.
rarity after you!
rarity [thunder cracks]
rarity [>applejack and >rarity yelp]
rarity perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
rarity oh! unacceptable.
rarity twilight?
rarity hah! we are most grateful for your invitation.
rarity uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
rarity it may indeed be a problem.
rarity oh! uh, goodness. uh, i do believe i have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] ah, silly me, i can't possibly stay here all night -- with applejack.
rarity slumber 101: all you've ever wanted to know about slumber parties but were afraid to ask.
rarity yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]
rarity silly! this is called a mud mask. it's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
rarity to reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
rarity did you hear that, applejack? you certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
rarity so do we have an agreement?
rarity oh! gross! you know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
rarity fortunately, i can get along with any pony, no matter how difficult she may be.
rarity <span class="anchor" style="display: none;" id="notaword">notaword</span>>applejack
rarity oh yeah? well, i'm the get-alongin'ist pony yer ever gonna meet.
rarity that's not even a word.
rarity yay.
rarity so, how are you getting along over there, applejack?
rarity never heard of it, but i have a much better one. it's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated every pony within a hundred miles! oo-oo!
rarity it is a ghost story, they're all made up.
rarity then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered -- that's critical -- and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. and done. ta-da! 
rarity you could at least say excuse me.
rarity i dare applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
rarity i think the truth of the matter is that some pony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
rarity !
rarity fine! 
rarity okay. i dare applejack to play dress-up in a fru-fru, glittery, lacey outfit.
rarity very. 
rarity i dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
rarity and i dare you to comb yours just once.
rarity oh, please. i am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. oh! it! is! on! 
rarity she started it.
rarity keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
rarity they were. there might still be a little on them.
rarity eww!
rarity i have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. get up.
rarity ah ah ah! you'll ruin it. you have to do it like this. mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
rarity hey!
rarity you did that on purpose.
rarity get up so i can fix it again.
rarity m-mmm!
rarity you will if you want any blankets.
rarity i will not!
rarity won't!
rarity won't!
rarity won't!
rarity no, it is i who have been trying my best.
rarity no, it was i.
rarity i!
rarity but i--
rarity wait! stop! don't!
rarity i tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
rarity cleaning up this mess some pony made. who was that again? oh, right, that's you.
rarity what was that?
rarity uh. uh, but i'll get all icky.
rarity oh. let's do this.
rarity u-ugh. oh, i look awful.
rarity hmph, thanks.
rarity is it smaller than a saddle?
rarity are we getting warmer?
rarity who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
rarity it is?
rarity well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
rarity oh, no, i'm sure i was much worse.
rarity oh, i'm much more sorry than you are.
rarity are too.
rarity are too.
rarity are too.
rarity now take two steps to your left. uh, no, my left.
rarity sorry.
rarity just look at those stripes! so garish!
rarity then, she lurks by the stores.
rarity she went outside!
rarity wicked, wicked zebra!
rarity i'm afraid i have to agree. [blows hair out of her face]
rarity [spike and twilight yell in surprise]
rarity yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
rarity and i as well.
rarity aah! or somepony stepped on her!
rarity oh! oh! pinkie, what are you doing? ah, really. aah! you ever hear of personal space?
rarity oh dear. oh, this is so unseemly. auuuaah!
rarity ooh... ahaha. easier said than done.
rarity oh. i look horrible!
rarity oh my. that place really does look horrible. nice decorations, if you like creepy!
rarity [ponies gasp]
rarity she stole your song?
rarity you saw those terrible things. now do you believe us twilight?
rarity you made me look ridiculous.
rarity and the creepy decor?
rarity not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
rarity ooh. i have never felt so lovely in all my life!
rarity stand still, rainbow dash.
rarity do you want to look nice for princess celestia or not?
rarity [flattered laughter] thank you twilight. nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
rarity huh?
rarity me too, oh, they're perfect.
rarity not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
rarity oh! are you okay? aaah!  eewww. aaah! gross gross gross. no creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique.
rarity ugh, pinkie, i'm a little busy right now.
rarity please, pinkie, i don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. i've got a real problem.
rarity i see we're having the same problem.
rarity ew! if you ask me it's already a total disaster.
rarity oh no... if they get inside my store... everypony for herself!
rarity my outfits! go on, shoo! get out of here, you naughty! naughty! 
rarity and even though i love my boots
rarity this fashion's getting old
rarity little critters hibernate
rarity under the snow and ice
rarity we help them gather up their food
rarity fix their homes below
rarity so their families can grow!
rarity well, how would you like to help create ponyville's finest birds' nests?
rarity why yes. when the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
rarity oh why, thank you most sincerely. would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
rarity okay. now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. now, weave them through there, yes. uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... i don't know i guess that would do... oh dear.
rarity oh, spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...
rarity spike. it's just fine. it's just a little rough around the edges. let me lend you a hoof. let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this, 
rarity ah, and we need to weave the string...
rarity oh, opalescence. can't you just picture it? moi, stepping up in a stunning new gown at the grand galloping gala in canterlot!
rarity why, yes! i did make it myself. thank you so much for asking.
rarity oh, opal, of course you can help me. thank you.
rarity what's that? you want to help me more! oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
rarity careful now. don't move. this shouldn't take long at all.
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity is there something i can help you with?
rarity oh, no, no, no! you can't wear this... old thing. you need a glamorous new outfit for the gala and i'll make it for you. no problem at all. it will be my pleasure!
rarity twilight sparkle. i insist on making you a new dress.
rarity not another word! i won't take no for an answer.
rarity let me guess, applejack. you don't want a new gown either.
rarity you can't possibly be serious, applejack! you absolutely must wear formal attire.
rarity what if i just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
rarity deal!
rarity idea! i'll make you an outfit for the gala too, rainbow dash.
rarity i'll make one for you and you and all of you. oh! and of course pinkie and fluttershy too. oh, and when i'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
rarity oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. plus, fun!
rarity then it's settled. we'll have a fashion show starring us.
rarity oh, applejack. you make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

rarity tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!
rarity stitch by stitch, stitching it together
rarity deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
rarity even if my fabric choice was perfect
rarity gotta get them all done by tonight
rarity pinkie pie, that color's too obtrusive
rarity wait until you see it in the light
rarity i'm sewing them together!
rarity well, i think...
rarity well...
rarity hour by hour, one more change
rarity i'm sewing them together, take great pains
rarity fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
rarity rainbow dash, what is on your mind?
rarity oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
rarity don't forget, applejack's duds must shine
rarity dressmaking's easy, every customer's call
rarity brings a whole new revision
rarity have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision
rarity ugh...
rarity streamers?
rarity streamers it is.
rarity aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
rarity do you not like the color?
rarity do you not like the shape?
rarity got to overcome intimidation
rarity remember, it's all in the presentation!
rarity piece by piece, snip by snip
rarity croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
rarity bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
rarity yard by yard, always stressed
rarity and that's the art of the dress!
rarity oh, opal. these are the ugliest dresses i've ever made.
rarity okay. i did exactly what each of you asked for. now don't hold back. let me know what you really think.
rarity well, i'm... happy that all of you are happy. i'm just relieved to finally be done.
rarity hoity-toity? he's coming here? to see these dresses?
rarity oh.  there he is! [deep breaths] okay. relax, rarity. your friends like their outfits and so will he. uuuaaa, what's wrong with the lights?! oh, yes. that means the show's starting. good.
rarity i'm never coming out! i can't show my face in ponyville ever again! i used to be somepony. i used to be respected. i made dresses. beautiful, beautiful dresses! but now everypony is laughing at me. i'm nothing but a laughing stock! 
rarity leave me alone! i want to be alone! i want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! do ponies wallow in pity? oh, listen to me, i don't even know what i'm supposed to wallow in! i'm so pathetic!
rarity exile... i guess technically i'd have to move away to live in exile. where would i go? and what would i pack? oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. what are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? are you supposed to pack warm?
rarity huh? opal?
rarity opal, how did you get up there? hang on, you poor dear! mama's coming!
rarity rainbow dash?! how dare you strand my poor opal in a tree?
rarity what is it? it's not... you... 
rarity like it? like it?!
rarity no, i don't like it.
rarity i love it!
rarity you ponies did an amazing job. it's exactly the way i imagined it.
rarity oh, i forgive you.
rarity but my whole career is still ruined!
rarity oh, thank you. thank you! oh, thank you so much!
rarity go on, go on.
rarity find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into cloudsdale. didn't you see how nervous she was?
rarity oh, puh-lease. i have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when i see it. we've got to find a way to be there for her. now go on!
rarity you've got to try!
rarity i will! for rainbow dash, i will go first.
rarity i most certainly am! aren't my wings smashing?! twilight made them for me. i just adore them! why so shocked? we couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
rarity yes!
rarity [in mirror] oooh! aaah!
rarity oh, wait for me!
rarity why, thank you!
rarity don't worry, twilight. i'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
rarity ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.
rarity [snowflake workers grumbling and yelling]
rarity hmm... yeah, i guess i could see that.
rarity oh, they were just admiring my wings rainbow dash.
rarity why, these old things? go ahead everypony. photos are encouraged.
rarity oh pfft. how can you ask me to put away perfection?
rarity waa-haa-haa!
rarity there really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. perhaps i should compete.
rarity i'm going to be awhile!
rarity i'm number four, and i need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
rarity rarity... is ready!
rarity well rainbow dash? shall we?
rarity good luck rainbow dash. just do your best. i hope you don't mind, but i took the liberty of changing our music. that "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.
rarity and now for my grand finale. i will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] they'll be talking about it for years!
rarity look upon me equestria, for i am rarity!
rarity [crowd oohs]
rarity uh-oh. 
rarity [screams some more]
rarity [more screaming]
rarity you sure did. oh thank you rainbow dash. you saved my life!
rarity i want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. i guess i just lost my head.
rarity and i'm especially sorry that i was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. can you ever ever forgive me?
rarity princess celestia, i am sorry i ruined the competition. rainbow dash here really is the best flyer in equestria.
rarity i certainly did. i learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
rarity where'd i put that? ohh, i thought i already...  ohh, and i can't forget i've got to-- oh, how am i ever gonna get this done?
rarity no!
rarity no thanks!
rarity just stand over there.
rarity where you'll be out of the way. ribbon, ribbon! where's the ribbon?!
rarity [clattering noises]
rarity aah!
rarity [crashing noises]
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity no. you've helped me quite enough.
rarity i understand. it's just that... i need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
rarity okay, all done. now, back to work. i've lost a lot of time, and i cannot have any more interruptions.
rarity [doorbell rings]
rarity oh, what now?!
rarity fluttershy! forgive me! i was so wrapped up in my work that i forgot you were bringing opalescence back from her grooming!
rarity oh, she looks great! i just don't understand how you're able to do it! i can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
rarity ahh! did you use... the stare on her?
rarity well, you should have a picture of opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
rarity i'm sorry i can't invite you to stay and chat, fluttershy. i've bitten off a bit more than i can chew with this order.
rarity no, sweetie, it's an expression. it means that i've taken on more work than i can handle. i've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! they're due in trottingham tomorrow morning.
rarity see? i've lined them in a special gold silk. it took so long to make, but i think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
rarity well, i, uh...
rarity i'll manage.
rarity hello, uh, girls ...
rarity sweetie belle! what have you done? that was the last of the gold silk! oh, now i'll have to make more! oh, i hope i can make more. i'm gonna have to work all night! which means... sorry, girls, i'm afraid the crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
rarity i just won't have any time to watch you if i want to get these robes delivered on time.
rarity no buts this time. i'm sorry, sweetie belle; it's just the way it has to be.
rarity i couldn't ask you to do that.
rarity have you met my sister and her friends? a problem is all it would be.
rarity i suppose that's true... and i do have a lot of work to do...
rarity i assure you, they're quite a handful.
rarity well... all right.
rarity hmmm...
rarity [clattering hooves]
rarity just delivered them. i have to admit, if you hadn't come along, i might not have. thanks again.
rarity i really must get back to the shop and clean up. girls! get your things. time to go. girls!
rarity girls! time to-- girls! your things! girls! it's time to-- girls!
rarity ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?
rarity ah, uh, speaking of which, i could use your help with opal.
rarity how about now? 
rarity [opal yowls]
rarity sweetie belle! i told you not to touch my things. come back with my supplies!
rarity perfect!
rarity [doorbell ringing]
rarity coming! welcome to carousel boutique, where every garment is chic, unique and magnifique.  sapphire shores! the pony of pop!
rarity you yah... y-y-you know my name?
rarity oh my stars. if i'm dreaming, do not wake me up. how may i help you, miss shores?
rarity how may i help you, sapphire?
rarity i have just what you need. sapphire shores, prepare yourself for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance de la haute couture. i used every last diamond i found on this one garment.
rarity really?
rarity beg pardon?
rarity spike, a lady is never jealous.
rarity ladies do not "flip out", spike. however, i was quite in awe. i need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. o, aha!
rarity yes, spike! right there!
rarity spike! i promised i'll give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or i'll never be able to make these outfits for sapphire.
rarity come along, spike. we have many jewels to find.
rarity spike!
rarity you've been very patient today, spike. and for that you'll get the finest reward. this is from me to you.
rarity is something wrong, spike?
rarity oh, bring the cart, spike. there are more over here.
rarity spike! where are you?
rarity you know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
rarity i think we're really going to strike gold this time. so to speak.
rarity well, spike, i think that's all we can do for today. and these will certainly get me well on my way with sapphire's outfits. why don't we start headi... oh! what's this? another jewel. oh, strange. it's in the trees. oooo... ewww! uh... uh... good day, gentle... uh, fellow. i am rarity and this is my friend spike.
rarity and you are...
rarity oh really? oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. i mean i-i know diamonds are a girl's best friend and now i know they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. so, um,  are you out hunting for gems as well?
rarity uh... we?
rarity spike! come on! hurry!
rarity waah! spike!
rarity unhand me this instant, you ruffians. stop! put me down, you scum! you rough-!
rarity spike! ah, dirt! aaaaah, aaaaah!
rarity save me...!
rarity oh, woe is me! what ever shall i do? ah! dirt, dirt! get away, dirt! oh! make it stop, make it stop! ah! filthy, disgusting dirt. it stings, it burns. help! oh, somepony save me, save me!
rarity oh please, diamond dogs. please let me go.
rarity but what ever do you want from me?
rarity oh! is that all?
rarity there. a lovely pocket of jewels are right there. now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?
rarity what? but you said you wanted me to find the gems.
rarity dig?
rarity ohh...
rarity forgive me but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, i had a pony pedi and i am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.
rarity i beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
rarity well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. when was the last time you two had a manicure? you're scratching up my coat with that jagged things.
rarity good heavens, what is that smell?
rarity ah, mystery solved. it's your breath.
rarity well, since you insist... but i must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. and this air is stifling, suffocating. and when i try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated. you look and smell like if you haven't bathed in weeks. have you never heard of soap? you could all do with a good round of soap and water. water, water, i'm terribly thirsty. could i please have some water?
rarity and that's another thing. i would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". i am a lady and i wish to be addressed as such. so you may call me "miss" or "rarity" or "miss rarity".
rarity whining? i am not whining. i am complaining. do you want to hear whining? thiiis iiis whiiining! oooh, this harness is too tiiight! it's going to chafe. can't you loosen it? oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! why didn't you clean it first? it's gonna leave a staaain! and the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do i have to pull it?!
rarity but i thought you wanted whiiining!
rarity anything?
rarity oh, this water is hardly sparkling. but i suppose it will have to do.
rarity what are you doing? hey, you spilled my drink. oh!  not sooo tiiight!
rarity did you just call me a... mule?
rarity mules are ugly. are you saying that i too am ugly? 
rarity he called me ugly!
rarity an old ugly mule! and it's true! just look at me. i used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
rarity you're just saying that!
rarity i don't believe you! you never liked me! 
rarity why, yes. hello, girls. you are just in time to assist me.
rarity with those.
rarity just because i'm a lady doesn't mean i cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. i had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
rarity me? what did i teach you?
rarity not if you eat them all, spike.
rarity so sorry, fluttershy. i hate being late for our weekly get-together. [to the spa ponies] the usual!
rarity but you will not believe what happened to me.
rarity oh, it's much more than all right. i was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street? but photo finish!
rarity she is the most famous fashion photographer in all of equestria. anyhow, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
rarity she was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
rarity do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
rarity but i'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. somepony with beauty. somepony with grace. somepony... like you!
rarity oh, this is such a huge opportunity. and it would mean so much to me.
rarity nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
rarity nopony!
rarity please!
rarity please!
rarity please, please, pleeease!
rarity oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! you are the best friend a pony could ever have!
rarity isn't it? though i was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that i felt completely frazzled. i think i feel a pimple coming on. oh! only one solution!
rarity [cut to the spa]
rarity the usual!
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity hm... she's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
rarity more light! it has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. oh, and the headdress need more feathers. pinkie pie! more feathers! and sequins! more sequins! and more ribbon! oh no! less ribbon. no! more ribbon. oh, this hem is completely off. pincushion! thank you all for helping me. i'm sorry to be so short with you, but i'm... i'm just so nervous.
rarity let me just say, what an honor!
rarity attitude and pizzazz!
rarity well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. i can't believe i ever thought i could impress her.
rarity really?
rarity did you hear that? i am going to "shine all over equestria".
rarity oh, never. i knew you'd be perfect.
rarity no, no, no, yes! that is definitely the one. photo finish is going to love it. everypony is going to love it!
rarity never.
rarity that's just what i was thinking. um... give me a moment and i'll, uh, put a little something together.
rarity but... but... how are you going to help me "shine across equestria" if i don't design something new for these pictures?
rarity oh, but you must, fluttershy. photo finish wants to make you a star. this is the opportunity of a lifetime. i know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. you must do this for me. you must. you must! you must!
rarity it didn't. photo finish wanted to work with fluttershy, not me.
rarity i just vant to be alone right now.
rarity wow. look how popular you are. i'm so excited for you. you must be having the best time ever.
rarity of course! i can't wait to hear all about the... "thing" at the place.
rarity i'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever i go.
rarity [door bell]
rarity welcome to carousel boutique!
rarity sorry. you just missed her. but you're still in luck. i'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs.
rarity rarity, of course.
rarity my hooves are getting positively pruney, i've been waiting here so long. obviously fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
rarity of course she did. she's a big bright shining star! i wish that star would burn out.
rarity i know, i know. and i should be happy for her, but instead i'm just... jealous! oh, please promise you won't tell her i feel this way. please, please, pleasepleaseplease!
rarity fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean i have to stop looking fabulous.
rarity guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
rarity [hilarity in the process of ensuing]
rarity oh no.
rarity bravo! i say bravo!
rarity such attitude! such pizzazz! she's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! bravo!
rarity fluttershy! are you all right?
rarity out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... oh... oh, fluttershy. it's so awful. i wanted them to.
rarity i'm jealous! i wanted all the attention. and instead it was going to you. i even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. but then, when it started happening, all i could think was how could i want you to fail at something you love so much?
rarity you do?
rarity then why did you keep doing it?
rarity and i thought if i told you how jealous i was of your success, you'd think i was a terrible friend.
rarity all this time!
rarity i promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
rarity cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
rarity we go!
rarity isn't it, though?
rarity applejack! were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
rarity no fair, applejack! you've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while i am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. how am i supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
rarity hmph! you talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
rarity it's widdle rarity who's all 'saddy-waddy'! urgh!
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity [indistinct conversations: >rainbow dash
rarity oh man, we're going fast! this is so exciting i can't even wait!
rarity for crying out loud in the morning!
rarity [more indistinct conversations: >fluttershy(?)
rarity i can't wait! >rainbow dash
rarity yeah, yeah!]
rarity would you all be quiet... noooow!!!???
rarity i just love their accessories!
rarity i want to speak to the manager!
rarity they took spike!
rarity ow!  gently, please!
rarity about the trees. now if you could â
rarity don't touch me! watch the dress! careful, you're gonna spill that on me! oh, oh, that looks delicious. what is it? oh, does it stain?! keep it away from me!
rarity stay right where you are. all i want is a clear path to the exit. nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! stay back! back, i say!
rarity put me down!
rarity are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
rarity mmm, i know how you feel. for the longest time i couldn't figure out why i didn't have mine.[rarity's flashback begins where there is a practice for a school play going on, a group of fillies, a younger version of cheerilee, the future teacher of apple bloom's class, are in costumes for the play: a group of fruit, a dandellion, a cake, a stack of hay, and a flower. the camera pans from group to the filly version of rarity, and her teacher, who are watching the play practice from behind the scenes.]
rarity i tried every trick i could think of, but nothing seemed to work. the costumes just weren't right. and the play opened that night.
rarity i had no idea where my horn was taking me.
rarity but unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason.
rarity i knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark!
rarity i knew that this was... my destiny!
rarity yes, scootaloo, that's exactly...
rarity there was an explosion i could never explain when i got my cutie mark.
rarity we've been bffs forever and we didn't even know it!
rarity do we have spike to thank again for this amazing spread? isn't he simply amazing?
rarity spike, you are such a little star that i had to make a little bow tie for you.
rarity ooh, poor little thing.
rarity and owlowiscious is just such a star i just had to make this little bow for you.
rarity [spike rages]
rarity come along, opal. let's hurry up and get to fluttershy's tea party.
rarity this punch is simply divine. is this the same recipe you used for your âspring has sprungâ party?
rarity bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirÃ©e.
rarity hmmâ¦ perhaps you could take a bath. how do i put this delicately? you smell like a rotten apple core thatâs been wrapped in moldy hay, and dipped in dragon perspiration.
rarity ooh! love the new hat. very modern. whatâs the occasion?
rarity the party is this afternoon? as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
rarity ohâ¦ do they?
rarity and iâm sure that we would, but iâm going to have to decline. i have toâ¦ wash my hair!
rarity it doesnât?
rarity see?  dirty! i have to go!
rarity she didnât see you at the sweet shop, did she?
rarity oh, good. iâd hate for her to ruin everything.
rarity have you seen her?
rarity me neither. can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
rarity me too! this is obviously going to be so much better.
rarity see you later!
rarity weâve been planning this party for such a long time. we had to make excuses for why we couldnât attend gummyâs party, so that we could get everything ready for yours.
rarity thatâs what weâve been trying to tell you, darling.
rarity aww, he was upset?
rarity pinkie pie! stop that right now. it's time to prepare for the gala and i refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
rarity where are the others? it's getting late.
rarity what ever shall we do?
rarity uh... ahem. excuse me. uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the gala?
rarity heavens no! we're getting dressed.
rarity i'm sorry, spike. some of us do have standards.
rarity we'll just have to see.
rarity at the gala, all the royals
rarity they will meet fair rarity
rarity they will see i'm just as regal at the gala! (at the gala)
rarity i will find him, my prince charming,
rarity and how gallant he will be,
rarity he will treat me like a lady, tonight at the gala!
rarity [>choir]
rarity this is what we've waited for, to have the best night ever!
rarity each of us will live our dreams, tonight at the gala, at the gala!
rarity find my prince
rarity to find!
rarity [sounds of excitement] hurry, rarity... oh, but not too fast. but don't wanna lose him... wait! have to play it cool. oh, but don't be cold! i can't lose him, i can't! he's everything i imagined! even better than i imagined.
rarity i am... rarity. oh my, what a lovely rose.
rarity this isn't at all what i imagined.
rarity i waited all my life...
rarity just give him a chance, rarity. his princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
rarity oh. prince blueblood! how chivalrous.
rarity yes. "one" certainly would.
rarity oh, of course it will.
rarity two apple fritters, please.
rarity ahem.
rarity ahem!
rarity i'm going to have to pay, aren't i?
rarity thank you, applejack. at least somepony here has good manners.
rarity [angry growl] you, sir, are the most uncharming prince i have ever met! in fact the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
rarity afraid to get dirty?!
rarity no! ugh! let's go!
rarity ...being together here has made it all better.
rarity ahem. i heard about your troubles, applejack, and i came to see if there's anything i can do without getting wet. or dirty. or out from under my umbrella.
rarity spike, twilight will come up with something.
rarity ooh. you can keep the elements. i'll take that case!
rarity i can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
rarity your horn! my horn! ahhh!
rarity see you in the center.
rarity i was expecting an audience with the princess, not outdoor sports. agh. oh my...
rarity yes, i like very much. no! no, i shan't succumb to such fabulousness. must... get to the center... to meet... the others.  mine! well, rarity. it took forever, but it was worth it. who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? now to get you home. 
rarity [wall crash]
rarity what do you mean, "boulder"? this big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! and it's all mine. keep your envious little eyes off it! i found it and it's mine fair and square! 
rarity little help here! thanks, twilight.
rarity but don't get any ideas about my gem! i know where you live.
rarity [thunder crash]
rarity hi-yah! try it, punk. he's mine. all mine! ya! ya! ya!
rarity don't touch my gem!
rarity forget it, twilight. i know what you're up to. the second i go in, you'll have your little minion spike come and take tom!
rarity well, it's not going to work.
rarity mm-mm.
rarity careful, twilight! you'll ruin his beautiful finish.
rarity mine!
rarity no, but if you want it, i want it!
rarity mine!
rarity what do you think you're doing? get away from my gem! get away--!
rarity let us never speak of this again.
rarity how in equestria can she think that tiny patch of cloud is cloudsdale?
rarity i thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
rarity whoa!
rarity pinkie! you were supposed to secure the rope!
rarity oh, fluttershy, would you be a dear and fly faster, please?
rarity [loud scream]
rarity [more loud screaming]
rarity why me-e-e-e-e-ee... whyyyy?! why? why-y?! and of all the worst things that could happen, this is the. worst. possible. thing!
rarity i've lost my diamond encrusted purple ribbon! i have searched high, and i have searched low. low and high! high and low! but i can't find it anywhere! anywhe-e-e-e-ere! how can i possibly finish my latest creation if i can't find it?!
rarity oh there it is. isn't it always just the last place you look?
rarity mmhm!
rarity yeah.
rarity hmm... there is one thing.
rarity i think i left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. could you get that for me?
rarity twilight? is there something bother-- twilight?
rarity please tell me i did not forget the plates.  i did. i totally forgot them. of all the worst things that could happen, this is the. worst. possible. thing!  why, why, why... uh... what? you didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
rarity [various shock statements]
rarity yes?
rarity yes?
rarity yes?
rarity [sighs of relief]
rarity oh, what a drama queen. mm. relatively speaking...
rarity don't look at what?
rarity of all the worst things that could happen, this is the. worst. possible. thing! what? i really mean it this time!
rarity as twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
rarity mmhmm.
rarity [all right, etc]
rarity and that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
rarity [fades in] [mumbling in sleep] oh... are those sweet... carrot... pancakes i smell?  mmm, how divine, num num num num. the aroma... spiced warm apple cider.  ahh, and, the smell of... smoke... smoke? smoke?! 
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity father! mother!
rarity i... figured.  i didn't know you could burn juice.
rarity vacation? is that this week? as in 'starting this very instant this week'?! uurh. let me guess: apple sauce?
rarity so, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?
rarity but i've got such a long to-do list. oh well, i suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
rarity now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
rarity well now, sweetie belle, i appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
rarity never fear, my dear, i'll get a proper breakfast going.
rarity oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, sweetie belle. let me just get things started.
rarity you are! you... can... put the garnish on the plates.
rarity okay, now easy! it has to be just right! no need to rush. no! that's too slow. careful! back up! looking for perfection here...
rarity not... bad.
rarity there are some things i must attend to. can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
rarity sweetie belle!
rarity am i? you washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! do you know how hard these things are to come by?
rarity the big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool- shrinks...
rarity nng... well. back to work. i must create.
rarity huh. stay out of trouble, okay? please?
rarity [in sweetie belle's mind] stay out of trouble, okay?
rarity oh no! did you use these gems?!
rarity but, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! i need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
rarity sweetie belle, what am i going to do with you?
rarity that's not what i meant!
rarity now i have to go and find some more of these gems!
rarity no! no thank you. you can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
rarity sweetie belle! i'm back! sweetie belle? [gasps in shock]
rarity my- ee- bleh- my inspiration room! what did you do? what did you do?!
rarity this wasn't a mess! it was organized chaos! i was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you- and you put everything away!
rarity but this was my mess, in my house! and now i have to start from scratch!
rarity happy?! happy?! i- i just need some time alone. hm!
rarity what a ridiculous idea. a contest at sweet apple acres? it doesn't sound... very... clean.
rarity sweetie belle, watch your tone! i am still your big sister.
rarity sweetie belle...! honestly! playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! with or without a sister.
rarity oh, i'm the one who's ruining your life?! really?! have you looked around this place? i'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
rarity deal!
rarity hmph!
rarity ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to sweetie belle. oh my. it's usually a big mess in here. [breathes in] id-ee-a! this is genius! i shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! if sweetie belle hadn't- [clears throat] no matter. she still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. hm!
rarity now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. ooh, my favourite sweater... i just can't believe that sweetie belle-
rarity oh, opal-wopal! it's as if sweetie belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. and sweetie belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. hm.
rarity perfect! just one more, and this ensemble is fini! rrgh, sweetie belle! where's her silly little arts and crafts project? oh, sweetie belle! my one and only sister! what have i done? all the time i could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!  woe is me! no! i must get her back! i must! as celestia is my witness, i shall never be sisterless again!
rarity sweetie belle! oh, i have been galloping all over looking for you. i-
rarity oh sweetie belle, i want to apologize. i am not better off without a sister.
rarity oh, sweetie, you don't know how happy i am to hear-
rarity what?!
rarity but i don't need lessons on being a good sister, i, i promise! listen! i'll show you how to cook my favourite quiche! or, or, i'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. won't that be fun? hm?
rarity uh... yes?
rarity well, that apology went swimmingly. applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
rarity of course i give. i give lessons. reasonable demands.
rarity but apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... i know what i need to do! i just hope it isn't too late!
rarity that we did, little sister. well, except for the start line.
rarity mm-hmm.
rarity us. i did it for us. you see? we are apple pie!
rarity uh, i'll explain later. for now, i think we deserve a celebration!
rarity the spa, of course.
rarity no, i, i, i'm serious.
rarity very well then, what shall we write to the princess?
rarity i agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. sometimes it's about compromising. sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. but mostly, it's about having fun together. even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
rarity a little bit dirty.
rarity a little bit dirty!
rarity deal!
rarity [birds chirping]
rarity a lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
rarity sincerest apologies, rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
rarity say you're sorry, opal.
rarity she's... sorry.
rarity tortoise!
rarity i certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it! 
rarity have you seen her costume? it is to die for! if you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
rarity i made the costumes. fabulous if i do say so myself!
rarity here? i get to stay here?
rarity thank you so much, princess.
rarity no, really. this is so nice of you.
rarity oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! i, i just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you!  thank you!  thank you!  thank you, thank you, thank you! [more kisses]
rarity thank you!
rarity thank you!
rarity that's perfect.
rarity [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rarity opal, do you know what i love about canterlot?  ahh. everything! i may have been born in ponyville, but i am a canterlot pony at heart.  now, i know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle i simply must make her something to express my gratitude. hmm... ooh! an outfit for her birthday party this weekend! perfect! don't you just love it here, opalescence?
rarity oh, this old thing? oh, it's just something i-
rarity oh, yes, of course... how are you?
rarity well, yeah, yes, but-
rarity [disappointed sigh]
rarity âlooked a little countryâ. ânot something you can get in canterlotâ. i'll show you something worthy of canterlot!
rarity i have to get started right away. this new design is very ambitious, and i've already written to twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party.  fancypants?
rarity oh goodness, i am so sorry. i didn't see you there, i've just got so many bags and i was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and--
rarity wh- the princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
rarity oh, it's for an ensemble i'm making for a friend. her birthday is in a few days.  again, i am really sorry i bumped into you.
rarity me?
rarity well, i'm, uh, ah- no- sure.
rarity rarity.
rarity pro: seeing the derby from a vip box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. con: going to the derby cuts into the amount of time i have to finish twilight's outfit. pro: fancypants is the most important pony in canterlot. his stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. con: twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the derby, but that doesn't mean i shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. my ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. i'd hate to let them down. and i won't. opal, i am going to the wonderbolts derby as a guest of fancypants! [excited giggling]
rarity pardon me. 'scuse me, 'scuse me!
rarity i don't think he has a chance against fleetfoot.
rarity [ponies gasp]
rarity my friend rainbow dash talks about her all the time. she says what fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
rarity uh...  why... she's... she's the... the wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
rarity ...and then i said, âpuh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"
rarity [ponies laughing]
rarity oh, i'd love to, but i-
rarity well, that sounds wonderful, but i-
rarity i'm flattered, really, it's just i have a project i really need to get started on, and-
rarity ...of course i'll be there.
rarity [the three ponies uttering relief]
rarity looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, opalescence. turns out bumping into fancypants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. of course, finishing twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but i can't possibly disappoint the canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can i?
rarity i'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go
rarity i'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity i'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow
rarity i'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity becoming as popular as popular can be
rarity making my mark, making my mark in high society
rarity i'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah
rarity i'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity see how they hang on every word that i speak
rarity my approving glance is what they all seek
rarity i'm the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, not just another jane doe
rarity i'm the type of pony everypony should know
rarity at home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht
rarity becoming the talk, the talk of all of canterlot
rarity i'm the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, not just another jane doe, yeah
rarity i'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know
rarity because i'm the type of pony
rarity yes, i'm the type of pony
rarity yes, i'm the type of pony everypony should know
rarity oh, i hope i haven't forgotten anything.
rarity we'd better get going.
rarity i must get back to ponyville with enough time to finish twilight's ensem-
rarity [letterbox clicks]
rarity for me? dearest rarity, your presence is requested at the canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon... yours, jet set and upper crust!  the canterlot garden party! why, next to the galloping gala that is the premier event in canterlot!  oh, but if i go, i'll miss twilight's birthday... but if i don't go, my new reputation in canterlot as a very important pony might be ruined! i might never be invited to another high society event again! friend's birthday... very important pony.  it's just too important. [takes deep breath] my dear twilight, i am afraid i won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to ponyville! i do hope you understand. your friend, rarity.
rarity no. but, i will need some help unpacking them.
rarity what do you think? too much? you're right. too little. ah, garden party, here i come!
rarity what are you-- how did you-- why are you--
rarity what i mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
rarity wow... first you get me a suite at canterlot castle and now this. i don't know what to say, twilight.
rarity this? uh- well i- i always put on something a little fancy when opal's feeling under the weather... cheers her right up. [laughs nervously]
rarity oh, uhh, she's... hold on a minute.
rarity [doors slam]
rarity i am so sorry about this.
rarity [running water]
rarity she's resting on the bed.
rarity yes.
rarity [sighs in relief] you don't know how glad i am to hear you say that.
rarity fancypants?! where?! ahh, i mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? haha.
rarity mmh... no reason i can't at least make an appearance... i'm here!
rarity i wouldn't have missed this for the world.
rarity ...yes, i always dab a little frosting behind my ears before i go out. [laughs nervously] after all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
rarity well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. think i'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. if you'll excuse me...
rarity i think i left the bathwater running in my suite.
rarity i really should go check on opal...
rarity is that princess celestia?
rarity i need to use the little fillies' room!
rarity can i get anypony more punch?
rarity i... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...? [trails off]
rarity what croquet mallet?
rarity [laughs nervously] ooh, that croquet mallet. i- well i, you know, the truth is... the truth is...
rarity i, i...
rarity twilight let me explain! i-
rarity you must understand! i-
rarity woo, wwwhy yes, i-i didn't want you to think i was being rude, so that's exactly the reason i didn't tell you. the one and only reason. [laughs nervously]
rarity twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. i don't know why i ever thought you wouldn't understand.
rarity nothing. see you girls later!
rarity oh no!
rarity [many birds chirping]
rarity [nervous laugh] yeah.
rarity [spit-take]
rarity fancypants! come with me! i'd like to show you this, er, thing, that's over there. on the other side of the room.
rarity that dress? oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old-
rarity yes. yes, i do know them. they may not be as sophisticated as some of you canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. and they are without a doubt the most important ponies i know.
rarity with pleasure!
rarity dear princess celestia, i wanted to tell you about the important lesson i learned during my visit.
rarity i learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. and that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
rarity hellooo?  anypony home? twilight?  is that a fire ruby?! huh, that must be at least twenty carats! no inclusions, pristine facets...
rarity oh, uh, of course. i just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to spike] did you say... delicious?
rarity thanks, twilight. i've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and i want to be ahead of the game...  i hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, spike. i've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
rarity like it? it's magnificent.
rarity i don't know what to say... this is so thoughtful. oh, my little spikey-wikey!  thank you so much!
rarity speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. i'm going to make one for each of you!
rarity i've been inspired by the generosity of my little spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts i've ever experienced. mmm.
rarity perhaps some more ruffle. 
rarity [ponies screaming]
rarity put me down, you brute!
rarity how rude.
rarity hey! i'm- not some- -sort of common- fly swatter!
rarity girls! my cape!
rarity oh be quiet. you've got nothing to be proud of. you steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! which, as horrible as it is, i can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. but this! [rips off dress] this is a crime against fashion! oh no. you are not getting this gemstone! this was given to me by my dear friend spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. and it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
rarity oh, what now? i suppose you'll be eating me or something? spike?! you're the rampaging dragon?
rarity spike, i just have to tell you how absolutely proud i am of you.
rarity yes. it was you who stopped... w-well you, from destroying ponyville. you are my hero, spikey-wikey! 
rarity oh, i do hope i look festive enough!
rarity fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
rarity of course not. all across equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for hearth's warming eve, in their own towns. it's tradition.
rarity well no. we're in the canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of equestria. a lot of ponies will come to watch us.
rarity hundreds.
rarity maybe even thousands!
rarity oh, my hair! applejack? be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
rarity my hair!
rarity how dare you! unlike you pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! h-m-ph!
rarity commander hurricane, please cease with the insults!
rarity i beg your pardon?! i am a princess! i won't be spoken to that way!
rarity clover the clever! i need you!
rarity those other tribes are impossible! i, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. the unicorns are noble, and majestic. we will no longer consort with the likes of them!
rarity we must find a new land!
rarity oh, this is simply taking forever. my hooves are killing me! how long have we been walking for?
rarity oh, i never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. but it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?
rarity stoooooop!
rarity that is what's wrong!
rarity [water rushing]
rarity i refuse to get my gown wet. i have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble pegasus. i, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. on the other hand, i have no trouble watching you stoop down.
rarity and do watch the gown, darling. it's worth more than all of the books in your library.
rarity i've never seen such jewels! this ruby is dazzling. this whole land is dazzling. i'm double dazzled!  in the name of the unicorns, i hereby dub this land unicornia!
rarity we found our new home!
rarity did not!
rarity all of you riff-raff are trespassing in unicornia!
rarity unicornia!
rarity that's barbaric. clover the clever? throw that brute into the dungeon!
rarity who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
rarity please, commander hothead.
rarity [clears throat] please, commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
rarity indeed not! you see this invisible line?
rarity clover the clever?
rarity that rock is clearly on the unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] who knows, there could be jewels inside.
rarity unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!
rarity give me my rock!
rarity [arguing over rock]
rarity you two deserve this horrible fate. you've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
rarity how ridiculous! a unicorn never stoops to fighting!
rarity pegasi are brutes!
rarity applejack, i thought you closed all the windows.
rarity i wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
rarity baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
rarity moi? babysit? n- oh nonononononononono. - i'm flattered that you would think about me though.
rarity oh, something just dreadful must have happened to applejack to make her not return!
rarity oh, applejack, thank heavens!
rarity yes, why are you here?
rarity and you are...?
rarity well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.
rarity and how did you meet miss jubilee?
rarity is it because you were insulted when i insulted your hair?
rarity yes. desperate times do call for desperate measures.
rarity that was rude!
rarity what? pinkie- 
rarity [railway crossing bells]
rarity when i get back, you're gonna get it, rainbow dash!
rarity this is just dreadful. even at top speed the apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
rarity of course.
rarity lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...
rarity she's dazzling!
rarity ohh.
rarity and the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
rarity why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a sunday morning, heh!
rarity how's our patient doing today?
rarity oh, well don't mind us rainbow dash.
rarity uh, on second thought-
rarity huh! hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
rarity pardon?
rarity fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
rarity you've got to stop being such a doormat.
rarity a pushover, darling. you've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
rarity watch and learn. hold it right there, mister small and handsome.
rarity oh, of course, you. nopony ever called you handsome before?
rarity oh, well they should! how about flexing some of your muscles for me?  oh my heavens! do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
rarity [bit clinking]
rarity see, that's not so hard, is it?
rarity alright then! what else is on your list?
rarity so, fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
rarity it was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
rarity oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
rarity well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. you truly are a whole new fluttershy.
rarity old rarity agrees.
rarity fluttershy! what are you doing?! that's no way to behave!
rarity no sweetie, he didn't. we saw the whole thing. we think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
rarity what happened to nice fluttershy? we want that fluttershy back.
rarity now, stop right there! let's not let things descend into petty insults!
rarity [starts crying] i cannot believe what that monster iron will has done to you!
rarity [knocks, clears throat] fluttershy, are you in there?
rarity oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
rarity shh.
rarity sweetie,  pinkie pie doesn't blame you, nor do i. you just received some bad advice from that iron will character.
rarity yes!  you can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
rarity oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
rarity what a darling little catchphrase.
rarity i'm sure a big, brave, powerful and rich monster- i mean, minotaur, like you, doesn't need that money right away. you can afford to come back later.
rarity do something!
rarity [wood crunching]
rarity in fact, you didn't change at all! you were the same old fluttershy that we've always loved!
rarity friends.
rarity what ever should we do, twilight? how do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
rarity yoo-hoo! well?
rarity [party horns]
rarity what do you think? am i the toast of the trench or what?
rarity nice is an understatement. i look fabulous! who says camouflage has to be drab?
rarity and 'formidable'.
rarity you leave him alone, rainbow dash! spike's style is unique. he doesn't have to look like other dragons.
rarity my little spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
rarity yes. you've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
rarity the cutest widdle chubby cheeks! ooooo!
rarity oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red, it is most becoming.
rarity oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
rarity hey guys!
rarity good morning!
rarity an early start?
rarity what?!?
rarity darling, this time i really do have to agree with rainbow dash. i don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutsey-wutsey head!
rarity oh, uh, quick, do something! stop him before it's too late!
rarity i suppose not.
rarity we know.
rarity goodbye, spikey-wikey!
rarity [through her grin] we're following him, right?
rarity oh, pish-posh! this costume is fabulous: one of my finer creations.
rarity we can't let little spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! he'll get clobbered!
rarity rainbow dash, i can't believe your silly plan actually worked. ow.
rarity forever?!
rarity spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? forever?
rarity and you're ruining my fabulous costume!
rarity fighting's not really my thing, i'm more into fashion, but i'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
rarity [dragons laughing]
rarity ohh, sweetie belle... was she raised in a barn or something?  oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, rarity... oh, but it's so much fun, rarity. hello... what's this?  gum on their bum!  too rich!
rarity bleh! i, i was just-
rarity oh, but this gabby gums column is so funny!
rarity it's so much juicier than anything in the boring old ponyville express. could i borrow this to show my friends?
rarity oh, they'd just love gabby gums! who is she, anyway? i've never heard of her before. is she a new-
rarity oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? the best hooficure i've ever had!
rarity we already read that one, rainbow dash. come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
rarity oh, lighten up, twilight, there's nothing but harmless gossip!
rarity rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
rarity everypony, please! she's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. you're really making too big a deal out of this.
rarity honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. so she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they dese-  i'll >destroy her! âthe drama-queen diariesâ... she's reprinted my diary! how could gabby gums possibly get access to my private diary?!
rarity my sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as gabby gums! i resent you even suggesting such a thing, twilight! why, she's the most innocent, most lovely-
rarity -most evil pony in equestria! how could my own sister steal my private diary? how could my own sister be... gabby gums?
rarity et tu, gabby gums?!
rarity the gilded pages of your betrayal!
rarity how could you do this to me?! you stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! gossip can be a very hurtful thing. it is an invasion of privacy, just like when i snooped through your saddlebag. you didn't like that much, did you?
rarity what is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
rarity do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
rarity i'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
rarity mmmm?
rarity although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
rarity what? is it a crime to change one's style every now and again? why, i think it's a crime not to.
rarity fine, i'm guilty!  i wear false eyelashes. oh, and i took a bite of the cake.
rarity you just made it sound so delectable.
rarity i only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
rarity terribly sorry.
rarity ahh!
rarity [running footsteps]
rarity it is gorgeous out. just gorgeous!
rarity [running footsteps]
rarity princess celestia wants me to-  ...wedding dress? for a canterlot wedding... i, ah, ooh, oooh!
rarity so let me get this straight. we're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the royal guard?
rarity ooh, ooh, oooh!
rarity i'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
rarity now let's get going, we've got work to do!
rarity your highness! let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]
rarity yes, of course. um, i've been working on it ever since i was given the assignment, and i think you'll be pleased with the results! mmm!
rarity oh, yes, of course.
rarity twilight, whatever are you talking about? cadance is an absolute gem!
rarity well of course she is! why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
rarity the princess is about to get married. i'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
rarity seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
rarity told you she was an absolute gem!
rarity ehm - i'll see what i can do.
rarity and mine! oof! ahaha... ha.
rarity they flew a flag of many hues
rarity oh, we have to get this right
rarity yes we have to make them see
rarity we can save the crystal ponies with their history
rarity oh, we have to get this right
rarity yes we have to make them see
rarity we can save the crystal ponies... with their history!
rarity it is so on!pinkie [prolonged gasp]
pinkie surprise! hi, i'm pinkie pie, and i threw this party just for you! were you surprised? were ya? were ya? huh huh huh?
pinkie well, that's silly! what kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? i mean, duh, bo-ring! y'see, i saw you when you first got here, remember? you were all "hello" and i was all [deep gasp], remember? y'see i've never saw you before and if i've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause i know everypony, and i mean everypony in ponyville!
pinkie and if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then i had an idea, and that's why i went [deep gasp]! i must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in ponyville! see? and now you have lots and lots of friends!
pinkie [kettle whistling]
pinkie aww, she's so happy she's crying!
pinkie [with mouth full] what? it's good!
pinkie [muffled disco music]
pinkie [clock ticking]
pinkie isn't this exciting? are you excited, 'cause i'm excited, i've never been so excited- well, except for the time that i saw you walking into town and i went [deep gasp] but i mean really, who can top that?
pinkie ooh, ooh, i love guessing games! is she hiding?
pinkie ooh, she's good. 
pinkie [ponies gasping]
pinkie ooh, ooh, more guessing games! um, hokey smokes! how about... queen meanie! no! black snooty, black snooty-[muffled noises]
pinkie "the elements of harmony: a reference guide."
pinkie [sing-song voice] it was under "e"!
pinkie whee! let's go!
pinkie especially if there's candy apples in there. what? those things are good.
pinkie bleh. ooo! [funny noises]
pinkie oh girls, don't you see?
pinkie [>pinkie pie]
pinkie when i was a little filly and the sun was going down...
pinkie the darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown
pinkie i'd hide under my pillow
pinkie from what i thought i saw
pinkie but granny pie said that wasn't the way
pinkie to deal with fears at all
pinkie she said: "pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
pinkie learn to face your fears
pinkie you'll see that they can't hurt you
pinkie just laugh to make them disappear."
pinkie ha! ha! ha!

pinkie chortle at the kooky

pinkie [ponies: mmm, muffins]
pinkie no, not baked goods, baked bads. 
pinkie eeew... spike, i threw those all away. where'd you get them?
pinkie hoof-biting action overload! she was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then rainbow dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!
pinkie and then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo.
pinkie rainbow dash!
pinkie rainbow dash.
pinkie but, but rainbow dashâ
pinkie butâ
pinkie i was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
pinkie hi, i'm looking for rainbow dash. have you seen her? hi there, have you seen rainbow dash? okay, thanks anyway. twilight, have you seen rainbow dash anywhere?
pinkie rainbow dash.
pinkie hi!
pinkie hi again.
pinkie pfeh. i need a favor, rainbow dash.
pinkie i totally promise it'll be totally fun.
pinkie over to the right. no no, a little to the left. oh wait, back to the right. now a little leftish while staying rightly. stop. hmm. maybe a few inches to the south. now a couple centimeters north. okay. one more smidgimeter to the--
pinkie uh, i mean, perfect. now wait for my signal.
pinkie oh rainbow dash, we startled spike into getting the hiccups.
pinkie oh no, you're not hurt are you?
pinkie oh, okay, good.
pinkie have you ever seen anything more hilarious? 
pinkie aah!       
pinkie are you  kidding?  i love to pull pranks. it's all  in good fun, and pinkie pie lo----oves to have  fun! 
pinkie that'd be  i'd really  when do  i mean  when would you 
pinkie mmm-hmm.
pinkie i don't know. this is gonna be gold.
pinkie aaa-choo!
pinkie [water splash]
pinkie is someone over there? who're we gonna squirt? who're we gonna squirt?
pinkie what?  nononononono, we can't prank fluttershy, i mean, she's so sensitive. it'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.
pinkie oh,  i've got someone in mind.  the toughest around.
pinkie oh, yes.  you're very close.
pinkie what's a griffon?
pinkie oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. gilda, you game?
pinkie oh. um, well sure, no problem. have fun you guys, i'll, uh, just catch up with you--  later. (blows a party hooter very sadly)
pinkie hey there.
pinkie it's later. and i caught up.
pinkie hey!
pinkie wow guys, that was really close, but i think rainbow dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
pinkie wait, guys! oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
pinkie yeah?
pinkie whaaa-aaaâ
pinkie hmph!
pinkie um, yeah. she keeps stealing rainbow dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. i've never met a griffon this mean. well, actually, i've never met a griffon at all, but i bet if i had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as gilda.
pinkie hmm?
pinkie jealous?
pinkie improve my attitude? but i... d... b.. it's gilda that... d... are you seri... [scream of frustration]
pinkie maybe twilight is right. maybe gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. maybe i'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. 
pinkie aw, poor granny smith, she didn't know it was a joke. how mean. no, no, i can't misjudge her. it was kind of a funny prank, i guess.&#160;:>gilda
pinkie i did misjudge her. she's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. nonononono, she might give it back. it's just a joke.
pinkie she's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. the meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. i can take it, but no one treats fluttershy like that. no. one. this calls for extreme measures, pinkie pie style.
pinkie welcome, welcome. welcome!
pinkie welcome. welcome.
pinkie don't worry your pretty little head about mean old gilda. your auntie pinkie pie's got it all taken care of.
pinkie gilda! i'm so honored to throw you one of my signature pinkie pie parties, and i really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
pinkie great.
pinkie well, i hope so. this wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
pinkie and i got my eye on you. everyone, i'd like you all to meet gilda, a long-time, dear friend of rainbow dash. let's honor her and welcome her to ponyville.
pinkie [ponies cheer]
pinkie please help yourself.
pinkie well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
pinkie you do?
pinkie [ponies chatter, birds singing]
pinkie cake time everypony.
pinkie now, i wonder who could've done that.
pinkie why? can't you watch me like a griffon?
pinkie yeah, gilda should definitely go first. let's get you blindfolded.
pinkie we're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
pinkie wait. the poster is this--
pinkie uh, gilda? you pinned the tail on the wrong end.
pinkie [ponies laugh]
pinkie ooh.
pinkie i shoulda known, that dribble cup had rainbow dash written all over it.
pinkie me? i threw this party to improve your attitude. i thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
pinkie hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
pinkie no hard feelings.
pinkie it's okay twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.
pinkie [ponies cheer]
pinkie this calls for a celebration!
pinkie ooo! i'm going to need balloons! one for every pony in ponyville!
pinkie let's see, that's one, two, three, four...
pinkie five, six...
pinkie seven.
pinkie hey, rainbow dash, wait up!
pinkie huh?
pinkie he should really see a doctor. that doesn't sound healthy at all.
pinkie oh, i mean, grrr!
pinkie ooo! pretty!
pinkie ooo, i think i have one in my bag!
pinkie [pop whistles]
pinkie come on, fluttershy, you can do it. flap those wings!
pinkie whoo-hoo! i win again!
pinkie there's nothing to be afraid of. it's just a hop, skip and a jump. see?
pinkie it's not very far
pinkie just move your little rump
pinkie you can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump
pinkie a hop, skip and jump,
pinkie just move your little rump,
pinkie a hop, skip and jump,
pinkie a hop, skip and jump,
pinkie a hop, skip and jump,
pinkie a hop skip and jump,
pinkie a hop skip and jump!
pinkie whoo-hoo! let's do it again!
pinkie spike is a dragon. you're not scared of him.
pinkie exactly! sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! hi!
pinkie apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. or sharing.
pinkie [busted horn]
pinkie psst! twilight! spike! come here! come! here! hurry! before she gets you!
pinkie z-zombie pony?!
pinkie i'm not alone in the dark.
pinkie glance evilly this way.
pinkie and spoooooky!
pinkie and that wicked enchantress zecora lives there doing her evil...stuff! she's so evil i even wrote a song about her!
pinkie she's an evil enchantress
pinkie she does evil dances
pinkie and if you look deep in her eyes
pinkie she'll put you in trances
pinkie then what will she do?
pinkie she'll mix up an evil brew
pinkie then she'll gobble you up
pinkie in a big tasty stew
pinkie soooo.... watch out!
pinkie it's a work in progress.
pinkie well, i heard that zecora eats hay.
pinkie yeah, but i heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
pinkie just like in my song! [starts singing a shorter version of "evil enchantress"]
pinkie she's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
pinkie if you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
pinkie then what will she do?
pinkie then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! soooo watch out!
pinkie ah pfurse!
pinkie pee pah zthecora! sthe put a cursthe on me!
pinkie ah am-pft!
pinkie pf-she's gone-pft!
pinkie nopthe.
pinkie plis place plooks horrible!
pinkie sthe sthtole my sthong! shthe shtole mm mm!
pinkie ah. hmm... pbth! 
pinkie you made me speak ridiculous!
pinkie oh my gosh! i never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. i mean i love talking so much and when i couldn't talk 'cause my tongue was all 'ehhhh'. it was the worst! don't you agree, fluttershy?
pinkie mmm... 
pinkie aaaaa... i know. that's why i'm tasting them. somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and i, pinkie pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
pinkie no, not at all. come on in and make yourself at home.  what's going on, fluttershy?
pinkie ugh! a parasprite? are you kidding?
pinkie ugh. now i gotta find a trombone.
pinkie a trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
pinkie does anypony know where i can find an accordion?
pinkie gals! hello! this is important. durgh! thanks a lot.
pinkie look rarity, applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] isn't that great?
pinkie and not a moment too soon.
pinkie and i'm not? you know how many more instruments i've gotta find? a lot, that's how many. now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
pinkie you've got a real problem alright, and a banjo is the only answer.
pinkie twilight, we don't have much time.
pinkie exactly. that's why i need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
pinkie you're right! getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. follow me. i said, follow me!
pinkie and you are all so stubborn.
pinkie they will be with these cymbals.  hey! give me those back!
pinkie i've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what i've done.
pinkie me? ruin? i'm not the ruiner, i'm the ruinee! or is it ruiness? ruinette?
pinkie hey! i'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. if you just slow down and listen to me!
pinkie look, tambourines! if you could all just...  [tambourines shake]
pinkie i'll save you!
pinkie hey, what happened to the princess?
pinkie oh no! have they got parasprites too? well, have tuba, will travel.
pinkie well duh, why do you think i was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? i tried to tell you.
pinkie thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when i don't understand me.
pinkie we've kept our hoovsies warm at home
pinkie time off from work to play
pinkie when the sun comes up
pinkie its warmth and beauty will glow!
pinkie 'cause tomorrow spring is here
pinkie helooooooo twilight! wheeeeeeee!
pinkie thanks twilight, i've been doing this since i was an itty-bitty little-wittle twinkie-pinkie. just comes natural. which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. i cut lines in the lakes with my skates. that way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
pinkie ha, tell me about it. hey, twilight, wanna help me out?
pinkie come on, put on those skates over there. i bet you'll be a natural too.
pinkie yaaaaay! 
pinkie yippie!
pinkie twilight, steer! steer!
pinkie oh boy...
pinkie twilight, you did a great job your first time around. i'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
pinkie no.
pinkie but did i make you feel better?
pinkie i think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hoofs on the ground. i know, fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
pinkie uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
pinkie you look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
pinkie eating cupcaaakes!
pinkie i don't have any cupcakes.
pinkie but you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
pinkie [>pinkie pie]
pinkie all you have to do is take a cup of flour!
pinkie add it to the mix!
pinkie now just take a little something sweet, not sour!
pinkie a bit of salt, just a pinch!
pinkie baking these treats is such a cinch!
pinkie add a teaspoon of vanilla!
pinkie add a little more, and you count to four,
pinkie and you never get your fill of...
pinkie cupcakes! so sweet and tasty!
pinkie cupcakes! don't be too hasty!
pinkie cupcakes! cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes!
pinkie oooh, those look much better than the last batch.  mmm...
pinkie what about that?
pinkie flour. it's flour! yay! i guessed it. what game you wanna play next? please say bingo, please say bingo.
pinkie we've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
pinkie don't forget your party hat, forgetty forgetterson!
pinkie welcome to the annual running of the leaves! this is pinkie pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
pinkie as everypony knows, the running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of equestria would never fall. so get ready, ponies. the running of the leaves will begin in five minutes.
pinkie racers! please take your positions!
pinkie hey, spike! what's up? oh wait, it me, i'm up!
pinkie what?
pinkie spike! would you like to be my co-reporter? we could comment on the action together.
pinkie climb on up.
pinkie all right, ponies, are you ready?
pinkie and they're off!
pinkie welcome to the official coverage of the running of the leaves! you know, spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. no, that's left to my little ponies.
pinkie ugh. those lazy, lazy leaves. but this year, the run is about more than the weather. it's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: applejack and rainbow dash.
pinkie yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
pinkie and i like fudge. but if i eat too much fudge i get a pudge and then i can't budge.
pinkie oh, no thanks. i had a big breakfast. let's check in with our two competitive ponies, applejack and rainbow dash. having come fast out of the gate, applejack and rainbow dash are evenly matched running neck in neck. but what's this? applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. but rainbow dash pulls at applejack's have-it and takes the lead. she's ahead by half a nose. or maybe three quarters of a nose. no, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
pinkie what an upset. i thought applejack had this in the bag.
pinkie she's the head of the pack, all right. the pick of the litter! the cat's pajamas! oh wait, why would applejack take some poor kitty's pjs? that's not very sporting of her.
pinkie welcome back, ponyvillians, it's me, pinkie pie.
pinkie i'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally i prefer mustard. how about you, spike?
pinkie aaand it looks like applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as rainbow overtakes her.
pinkie applejack, what are you doing up here?
pinkie i must say, spike, that this has been the most interesting running of the leaves in equestria history!
pinkie but it isn't the running that's been fascinating. it's the lack of running!
pinkie once again, rainbow dash and applejack are neck in neck, jockeying for position. applejack inches ahead, now it's rainbow, it's applejack, it's rainbow dash, it's applejack--
pinkie oh yes, she di'id!
pinkie it's applejack, it's rainbow dash, it's applejack, it's rainbow dash--
pinkie for last.
pinkie i love something! something is my favorite!
pinkie don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?
pinkie balloons?
pinkie do it!
pinkie more balloons! oh no, that's too many balloons. more candy! oh, less candy. oh wait, i know. streamers!
pinkie whose dress is this?
pinkie all we ever want is indecision
pinkie are you as happy with them as we are? huh? huh? huh?
pinkie i don't believe it!
pinkie rarity? you okay in there? you haven't come out for days.
pinkie she'll become a crazy cat lady!
pinkie give her time.
pinkie we all finished your dress for you.
pinkie we're so super sorry.
pinkie ooh!
pinkie hmm... twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
pinkie oh! it's my tail! it's my tail! it's a-twitch a-twitchin'! and you know what that means!
pinkie the twichin' means my pinkie sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! you should better duck for cover.
pinkie he just said, "nice catch" in frog.
pinkie [frog croaks]
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>]
pinkie um... twilight? you gotta little somethin' on your face there.
pinkie nah! i could just see it.
pinkie [pinkie pie skips away singing]
pinkie my tail! my tail! twitch-a-twitch! twitch-a-twitch! somethin' else is gonna fall!
pinkie it's okay, my tail stopped twitching.
pinkie [pinkie pie begins skipping away singing]
pinkie my ears are flopping! my ears are flopping!
pinkie i'll start a bath for you.
pinkie sooo, basically, it works like this: i get different, little, niggling feelings and they mean different things. like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. and, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
pinkie no, but my shoulder's achy. that means there's an alligator in the tub.
pinkie no it's not, silly! this is my pet alligator, gummy. he's got no teeth. see? haha!
pinkie what's not to believe? you do magic, what's the difference?
pinkie that's so not true twilight! sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. i call 'em "combos".
pinkie sure! you know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. that means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
pinkie uh oh, i feel a combo coming on. ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
pinkie oh no-no-no-no-no. you're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. this was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. that usually means "look out for opening doors". you okay?
pinkie you don't believe because you don't understand.
pinkie okey-dokey-lokey!
pinkie [steam stack whistling periodically]
pinkie nopey-dopey!
pinkie wait! hold on! uhh, no.
pinkie i don't control it, they just come and go.
pinkie sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
pinkie wait, hold on, i'm feeling something...
pinkie it's my tummy! that usually means i'm hungry! let's eat!
pinkie okey-dokey-lokey.  uh-oh.  hu-bu-bu-bu-bu [falls over backwards]
pinkie uh-huh.
pinkie mmm... 
pinkie hey, applejack. whatchya doin'?
pinkie oh, letting twilight secretly follow me all day, without me knowing.
pinkie silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
pinkie all done, clear skies from here on in, as far as i can tell-- hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. something you never expect to happen is gonna happen! hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! and its gonna happen... at froggy bottom bog!
pinkie uh, i'm not sure.
pinkie okey-dokey!
pinkie [gate creaks]
pinkie [frogs croak]
pinkie hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie no thanks, i'm fine.  hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie woah!
pinkie what if... what if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?
pinkie fluttershy? 
pinkie i'm so glad everything's alright.
pinkie is that a hydra!?
pinkie ooph! 
pinkie oh, lookie there, it stopped. o-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n.
pinkie [ponies gasp]
pinkie whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
pinkie t-t-t-twilight!
pinkie [hydra chirps]
pinkie [ponies gasp]
pinkie [hydra roars]
pinkie t-t-t-twilight! you have to jump!
pinkie you'll be fine!
pinkie its your only ho-o-ope! you have to take a leap of faith!
pinkie i knew you could do it, twilight!
pinkie that wasn't it.
pinkie the hydra wasn't the doozy.
pinkie [hydra spits]
pinkie i'm still getting the shudders. oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. you see? there it is again. whatever the doozy was at froggy bottom bog, my pinkie sense says it still hasn't happened.
pinkie dunno, but it just wasn't it.
pinkie [kettle whistles]
pinkie y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
pinkie oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. ooh!  that was it. that's the doozy.
pinkie you believing. i never expected that to happen. that was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was!
pinkie [pinkie pie skips off, singing]
pinkie honk!
pinkie there it goes again.
pinkie you never know.
pinkie [jet engine sound]
pinkie it's where all the greatest pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! some are fast! [makes car sounds] and some are graceful. woah, woah, wooooaaaaaahh!
pinkie ooh! i'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! it's like, the most coolest thing ever! even though i've never actually seen it, but i mean come on! it's a sonic rainboom! how not cool could it possibly not be?!
pinkie you really need to get out more. the sonic rainboom is legendary! when a pegasus like rainbow dash gets going soo fast... boom! a sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
pinkie yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
pinkie a flight spell? one sec. page twenty-seven.
pinkie it landed on my face when rainbow dash knocked me into the bookcase.
pinkie sure did!
pinkie haha. pretty cool, huh?
pinkie yes!
pinkie spicyyyyyy!...
pinkie we still love you.
pinkie holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
pinkie ow!
pinkie wait for me! wheee!
pinkie i can't believe you got all these gems!
pinkie cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
pinkie we won't say a word!
pinkie twilight! you promised spike you wouldn't say anything. he trusts you. and losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
pinkie forever!
pinkie how'd it go? how'd it go?
pinkie forever!
pinkie forever!
pinkie mmm... juicy!
pinkie [(shows using gestures) zipping her mouth, locking it with the key, digging a hole, burring the key in that hole, building a house atop that hole and moving into that house.]
pinkie uh, yes! obviously, that's why i zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house up top the hole where i buried the key, then moved into the house atop the hole.
pinkie and you were doing so well.
pinkie awwww!
pinkie no, are you asleep yet?
pinkie oh yeah! 
pinkie what tree? you mean bloomberg?
pinkie fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
pinkie rainbow dash thinks fluttershy's a tree!
pinkie she's not a tree, dashy!
pinkie oooh, looky! now they're doing tricks!
pinkie ooh! ooh! ooh! now do a back-flip!... or... just jump?

pinkie mmm!  before we finish eating? are you loco in the coco?!
pinkie can i please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?
pinkie huh?
pinkie well that's not very nice. right, rainbow dash?
pinkie hi guys!
pinkie we didn't!
pinkie hey! i've got an idea!
pinkie we may be divided
pinkie but of you all, i beg
pinkie to remember we're all hoofed
pinkie at the end of each leg
pinkie no matter what the issue
pinkie come from wherever you please
pinkie all this fighting gets you nothing
pinkie but hoof and mouth disease
pinkie arguing's not the way
pinkie hey, come out and play!
pinkie it's a shiny, new day
pinkie so, what do you say?
pinkie you gotta share
pinkie you gotta care
pinkie it's the right thing to do
pinkie you gotta share
pinkie you gotta care
pinkie and there'll always be a way through
pinkie both our diets, i should mention
pinkie are completely vegetarian
pinkie we all eat hay and oats
pinkie why be at each other's throat?
pinkie you gotta share
pinkie you gotta care
pinkie it's the right thing to do
pinkie and there'll always be a way
pinkie thro-o-o-o-ugh!
pinkie oh... that wasn't the message of my song at all...
pinkie wah-ahh! woah-oo-oo-oo-ooah!
pinkie hey! that's what i said!
pinkie cookies, candies and pies, oh my! [pie in the face] oooh! chocolate fountainy goodness! [head in choclate fountain, choclate hardens and eats it] you gonna eat that?! hey!
pinkie hi!
pinkie [philomena bursts into flames]
pinkie no, it's my fault! wait, what are we talking about?
pinkie you're looking for rainbow dash? if i was her, i'd be at sugarcube corner. of course, if i was anyone, i'd be at sugarcube corner. hey! i have an idea! wanna go to sugarcube corner?
pinkie cutie mark? come with me and i'll tell you how i got mine!
pinkie alright!
pinkie my sisters and i were raised on a rock farm outside of ponyville. we spent our days working the fields. there was no talking. there was no smiling.  there were only rocks. we were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden...
pinkie i never felt joy like that before. it felt so good i just wanted to keep smiling forever. and i wanted everyone i knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. i wondered, how else could i create some smiles?
pinkie and that's how equestria was made.
pinkie maybe on the way home i can tell you the story of how i got my cutie mark. it's a gem!
pinkie i heard that boom! and right afterwards there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
pinkie we all owe our cutie marks to you!
pinkie i love you, guys!
pinkie little spikey-wikey! who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
pinkie mmm. wow! these cookies are deeleesh!
pinkie and now the punch has been... spiked!
pinkie oh, what a fantastical, fluffelicious feathery little friend! i'm... hooked!
pinkie [everybody laughs]
pinkie i swore i had one here somewhere. ah, here it is! a quince!
pinkie right. a quail? a quilt! a quesadilla? aha! a quiche! [pronounced phonetically]
pinkie nope. sorry. all outta quills.
pinkie [rasping voice] next time, i think iâll just pass out written invitations.
pinkie &#8203;&#91;&#8203;<a href="/wiki/my_little_pony_theme_song" title="my little pony theme song">theme song</a>&#8203;&#93;&#8203;
pinkie hey, girls!
pinkie just wanted to tell you how happy i am that you can make it to gummyâs party.
pinkie aw! itâs just a boring old apple. donât worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
pinkie i canât tell you that, silly. then it wouldnât be a surprise.
pinkie nope! something new. itâs gummyâs favorite. ooh, this is my jam!
pinkie having fun?
pinkie theyâre always the best parties âcause my best friends are always there! câmon, everypony! gummy wants to dance! go, gummy! itâs your birthday! go, gummy! itâs your birthday!
pinkie you sure you donât wanna stay? thereâs still some cake left.
pinkie we should do this again soon!
pinkie itâs soon!
pinkie you said we should have another party soon, andâ¦ itâs soon! hereâs your invitation!
pinkie all our bestest friends are invited, and thereâs gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
pinkie yes, indeedy!
pinkie i understand. your studies come first. but donât worry, weâll be sure to save you some cake.
pinkie oh! and twilight, you shouldnât hit the books. you should really just read them.
pinkie whoâs ready to shake their hoof-thang?! itâs an invitation to âgummyâs after-birthdayâ party this afternoon. thereâs gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
pinkie thatâs funny. thatâs just what twilight said, and the answer is, âyes! itâs this afternoon!â
pinkie okey dokey lokey! a party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.
pinkie gummyâs after-birthday party is this afternoon. iâm delivering the invitations.
pinkie itâs so strange. everypony keeps saying that.
pinkie i know itâs short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, i thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
pinkie donât be silly, your hair doesnât look dirty.
pinkie nope!
pinkie huhâ¦ no twilight, no applejack, no rarity. oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.
pinkie yes! as in, this afternoon this afternoon!
pinkie both of you?
pinkie wait! maybe i could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. whoâre you house-sitting for?
pinkie harry?
pinkie thatâs strange. i know just about everypony around here.
pinkie a bear?
pinkie wait! thereâs a bear around here who lives in a house?
pinkie heâs vacationing at the beach?
pinkie something strange is definitely going on around here, gummy. sure rainbow dash and fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? rarity has to wash her hair? applejack has to pick apples? twilight is behind on her studies, and has to hit the books? the more i think about it, the more those are starting to sound likeâ¦  excuses!
pinkie that doesnât look like studyingâ¦ or hitting!
pinkie butâ¦ weâre friends. what wouldnât twilight want me to know anything about?  she's coming back.
pinkie time to get to the bottom of things!  i think our coverâs been blown! weâll need a new disguise.
pinkie i thought everypony loved my parties.
pinkie rainbow dash! wait!
pinkie whereâre you going?!
pinkie what's the real reason you didn't want to come to gummy's party?!
pinkie what's in those bags?!
pinkie i know you're in there!
pinkie mind if iâ¦ take a look inside the barn?
pinkie rainbow dash just went in there.
pinkie okeyâ¦ dokeyâ¦ lokey.
pinkie secrets and lies! itâs all secrets and lies with those ponies! theyâre up to something, gummy! something they donât want me to know about! well, iâm gonna know about it! iâm gonna know about it big time! and i know just whoâs gonna tell me all about it. tell me all about it big time!
pinkie itâs all yours, spike. all you have to do is talk.
pinkie no, no, no. talk about our friends.
pinkie grr! no! youâre not understanding me! i want you to confess!
pinkie confess!
pinkie and?
pinkie aaand?
pinkie no! no! no! no!
pinkie tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they donât like my parties, and they don't want to be my friends anymore! 
pinkie ah-ha! i knew it! [balloon deflating noise] oh no, my friends donât like my parties and they donât want to be my friends anymore.
pinkie thank you all so much for coming! it means so much to gummy.
pinkie well, of course you can have some more punch, mr. turnip. 
pinkie why, thank you, rocky.
pinkie iâm so glad sir lintsalot. 
pinkie anything for you, madame le flour
pinkie oh, theyâre not so bad.
pinkie [low string instrument whine]
pinkie oh, câmon now. âlosersâ might be a little strong, donâcha think?
pinkie well, it was pretty rude...
pinkie it was, wasnât it?
pinkie you know what? iâm not gonna speak to them ever again. and iâm not gonna invite them to another party as long as i live! they donât deserve to be invited to my parties.  not after the way theyâve been acting.
pinkie who could that be?
pinkie i know how it goes, all right!
pinkie no thanks. iâm spending time with my real friends. isnât that right, madame le flour?'
pinkie another slice of cake, sir lintsalot?
pinkie i most certainly am not. iâm having a wonderful time right here.
pinkie no!
pinkie i said, no!
pinkie noâ¦ iâ¦ donât!
pinkie excited? excited? why would i be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
pinkie yes! you donât like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! a âfarewell to pinkie pieâ party!
pinkie why? why? why? because youâve been lying to me and avoiding me all day, thatâs why!
pinkie because itâs my birthday! ooh, how could i have forgot my own birthday?
pinkie [ponies sigh in relief]
pinkie and you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
pinkie you girls are the best friends ever! how could i have ever doubted you?
pinkie you girls wouldnât mind if we celebrated gummyâs after-birthday party too, would you? his party was cut short, and heâs pretty upset about it.
pinkie ahh! i... can't... believe... the grand... galloping... gala... is... tonight!
pinkie what's twilight doing?
pinkie an apple! are we having pie?
pinkie busy having fun!
pinkie i am here at the grand gala, for it is the best party
pinkie but the one thing it was missing was a pony named pinkie
pinkie for i am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree
pinkie ponies playing, ponies dancing, with me at the grand gala!
pinkie to whoop!
pinkie the shiny dance floor... the pretty party ponies... ooh, the fancy band... shiny! pretty! fancy! [anxious noise] gotta dance!

pinkie i'm at the grand galloping gala... and it's not what i dreamed.
pinkie and i'm not going to...
pinkie c'mon everypony! i know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!
pinkie that's what i'm talking about

pinkie hey, look! we're famous!
pinkie hold on a second! eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. chocolate rain!
pinkie oh, well. if anyone needs me, i'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
pinkie he's standing on your head!
pinkie see you guys there!
pinkie whee! this is the greatest balloon garden i've ever seen! it's the first balloon garden i've ever seen, but still! wah!
pinkie hey, what gives?
pinkie it's different. they're laughing at me.
pinkie my friends laugh with me, not at me.
pinkie no! stop it!
pinkie stop laughing at me!
pinkie happy? i don't think so.
pinkie [balloons popping]
pinkie oh you are, huh? why? need a good laugh?
pinkie and what are you laughing at?
pinkie why? need a good laugh?
pinkie and what are you laughing at?
pinkie well, quit it! you'd better think before you laugh at the pink...ie pie!
pinkie quit it!
pinkie quit it!
pinkie quit it! stop it!
pinkie chocolate milk? i hate chocolate milk!
pinkie what 'chu laughin' at?
pinkie this may look like fun, but it's not.
pinkie i hate libraries!
pinkie i hate the elements of harmony!
pinkie it's your fault it didn't work.
pinkie any of you! to all of you! i'm outta here!
pinkie and i-i turned gray!  can you believe it?!
pinkie yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
pinkie whoa!
pinkie oops.
pinkie wait-wait-wait! 
pinkie [various shock statements]
pinkie yes?
pinkie yes?
pinkie yes?
pinkie [sighs of relief]
pinkie oh twilight, you're such a crack-up! 
pinkie we're never gonna see twilight again!
pinkie you can't punish her!
pinkie mmhmm.
pinkie [all right, etc]
pinkie ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
pinkie [chicken squawk] enough chitchat! time is candy!
pinkie too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] never.
pinkie yeah! great costume, twilight! you make a fantastic weirdo clown!
pinkie twilight, twilight! look at our haul! ah! can you believe it? and then, we went to cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. didn't we, pip?
pinkie and then, we had to stop and wait for granny smith, and-[lightning zap] bwak!
pinkie everypony! just dump some candy and get out of here!
pinkie ah! it's nightmare moon! run!
pinkie did you hear that, everypony? nightmare moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
pinkie fluttershy! you've gotta hide us! nightmare moon is here and... [chicken squawk] she stole fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!!!
pinkie hey, gals. anypony seen pip? we lost him the last time we had to run... [chicken squawk] aaah! nightmare moon is gobbling pipsqueak! everypony run!
pinkie [chicken squawk]
pinkie okay.
pinkie mmhm. [chicken squawk]
pinkie nightmare moon!
pinkie ...well, duh.
pinkie i know that. sheesh, twilight. i'm almost as big as her. how's she gonna gobble me up?
pinkie sometimes it's just really fun to be scared.
pinkie no, i'm not. i'm a chicken. [chicken squawk]
pinkie a party will cheer you up.
pinkie yesterday i told mrs cake that i ate two corn cakes, but i really ate three! okay six! i ate six corn cakes!  make it stop! oh, make it stop!
pinkie we were totally gonna invite you, rainbow, then twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and fluttershy and i nodded our heads in agreement like this.
pinkie wait! look!
pinkie tortoise!
pinkie ahh! it's rainbow dash! it's her! it's rainbow!
pinkie you got your perfect pet, right?
pinkie you did! you did say that! she did say that, that was the rule!
pinkie you may be right...silly.
pinkie mm-hm.
pinkie spike's a ghost!
pinkie i saved the construction workers with my pinkie sense. 
pinkie [flowerpot shatters]
pinkie it's alright.
pinkie yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. 
pinkie [yelping and screaming]
pinkie [fades in] swoosh! and right before she hit the ground, shoom, she- hi again!
pinkie balloons are super easy to pack.
pinkie [air let out of balloons]
pinkie isn't it fancy pants?
pinkie oh, i never leave home without my party cannon.
pinkie tada.
pinkie let's party!
pinkie [swing music]
pinkie mmm!
pinkie [blows party hooter] happy birthday! party time, woohoo!
pinkie duh! the party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to sugarcube corner, 'cause the cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
pinkie i said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
pinkie [door slams]
pinkie back! get back! 
pinkie [pie splats]
pinkie i'm not giving him cake, i'm assaulting him with cake!
pinkie how dare you take the cake!
pinkie somepony do something!
pinkie there it is! canterlot!
pinkie i spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
pinkie [cash register kaching]
pinkie ...and it's me!
pinkie twilight, let me handle this.
pinkie us?! we're not hogging all the food, you are! oh wait. you're right. it's us. well, it's only 'cause you mean old pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!
pinkie well, if you non-earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then i'm just plum out of ideas.
pinkie no, i'm first!
pinkie maybe for you, smart cookie. but i am a chancellor. i was elected because i know how to think outside the box. which means [slightly echoes] i can also think inside the chimney. can you think inside a chimney?
pinkie i didn't think so.
pinkie ohmygosh. hold on to your hooves â i am just about to be brilliant!
pinkie i have decided that the earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
pinkie don't worry about them. we're the ones with all the food, right?
pinkie fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. and with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?
pinkie the point is...
pinkie we must find a new land!
pinkie yes, yes. this is definitely the right direction.
pinkie but that's impossible. are you suggesting that i'm reading the map wrong?
pinkie of course! how else could i see where i was going?
pinkie or talk? i need to be able to talk! i mean, how would we survive if i just suddenly shut up?
pinkie i got a newsflash for you, cookie. the earth is round. there is no up or down.
pinkie relief? you don't need relief! if anypony needs relief around here it's me! i'm a chancellor! i'm a bigshot! you're just my, um... my, uh...
pinkie whatever. you take the map, while i enjoy some relief.
pinkie the air! the trees! the dirt. this dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
pinkie in the name of the earth ponies, i think i'm gonna call this new place... uh... dirtville.
pinkie earth! congratulations to me for thinking of it.
pinkie we found our new home!
pinkie i planted mine earlier than first.
pinkie earth!
pinkie wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?
pinkie uh... smart cookie!
pinkie oh look, you found my rock. i've been looking for it everywhere.
pinkie finders keepers, losers weepers!
pinkie [arguing over rock]
pinkie yeah! worse! i haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
pinkie [ice cracking]
pinkie unicorns are snobs!
pinkie i wanna see the new baby pony! i wanna see! which one is it?!
pinkie two new foals for me to play with?  that's two, two, two times the fun! this is the greatest day ever! we need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! woohoo!
pinkie but i was just-
pinkie but-
pinkie happy happy birthday, to you and you today-
pinkie quick! make a wish and blow out your candles! which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! you are zero years old, after all!
pinkie happy monthiversary to you and you today
pinkie [very quickly] i can't believe you're already a month old time sure flies doesn't it well it seems like only yesterday you were born.

pinkie ah, no thanks. i just had a big breakfast.
pinkie oh, oh, you're making funny faces! i have one! bleghhh-
pinkie all set now? everything good? okay, who wants to play again?
pinkie except food.

pinkie i could do it! i wanna do it! oh the babies love playing with me, i'll do it!
pinkie me! me! pick me!
pinkie i'll do it! pick me!
pinkie i wanna babysit! pick me!
pinkie ooh, ooh, i wanna do it!

pinkie [doors bang]
pinkie i can be responsible. why, responsibility is my middle name. pinkie responsibility pie.
pinkie yes, i know, i will. i am.
pinkie whoa! that's a lot of responsi- consider it done.
pinkie no problemo, mr. and mrs. cake. everything is under control.
pinkie uh oh.
pinkie oh, don't cry little friends! look, look! where's pinkie pie... where's pinkie pie?
pinkie oh no... i'm right here, see!
pinkie [warbling noises]
pinkie oh, think think think... aha!
pinkie hey guys, watch this!
pinkie hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight, where y'all from? well that's great. y'know, i used to have an ant farm, but i had to get rid of it because i couldn't find tractors that small!
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie get it? tractors that small?  the other day, i spilled spot remover on my dog, and now i can't find him!
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie gee, tough crowd. [to herself] tell me about it. fine, i wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and i think you deserve it!
pinkie first you jiggle your tail! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wriggle your snout! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wiggle your rump! oink oink oink!
pinkie then shout it out! oink oink oink!
pinkie first you jiggle your tail! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wriggle your snout! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wiggle your rump! oink oink oink!
pinkie then shout it out! oink oink oink!
pinkie first you jiggle your tail! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wriggle your snout! oink oink oink!
pinkie then you wiggle your rump! oink oink oink!
pinkie then shout it out! oink oink oink!
pinkie there, see? nothing to this babysitting business! ugh!
pinkie snack time. that's easy enough. okie dokie! eat up! like this! numnumnum, numnumnumnum! ahh!
pinkie no, pumpkin cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
pinkie huh, huh? uh hey guys, look at me!
pinkie achoo!
pinkie ...yeah. i think i can see where this is going. 
pinkie [water running]
pinkie towels are not food, pumpkin cake!
pinkie drop it... drop it... drop it!?
pinkie ooh, look guys, bubbles!
pinkie [bubble pops]
pinkie uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry, look, look, uh floating things! ooh, aaah, eeh!
pinkie uh, don't make me do it, guys! you know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
pinkie [hoof on nose] smells like somepony needs me to changie-wangie their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow! [tiptoeing noise] easy... easy...
pinkie [fight sounds; >pound cake and >pumpkin cake giggling throughout]
pinkie wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still i've almost-
pinkie oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
pinkie [bell rings]
pinkie oh! thank goodness they're home!
pinkie thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! i can't begin to tell you what my day has been like, i mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie excuse me?
pinkie is that so? well, thanks for stopping by, twilight. sorry, i don't have time to visit, i'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
pinkie well, of all the- she thinks i can't handle things on my own! maybe because i haven't handled things on my own. well, i can handle things on my own!
pinkie pound cake.  this is a crib. it is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey western fort. it is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
pinkie and you, young filly. we do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. so, fall asleep!
pinkie [kisses twice] sleep tight.
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie now that's what i call handling things. 
pinkie oh, nononono. not good not good not good! pound? pumpkin? where are you? come out come out wherever you are!
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie whoa! you be a good little girl now, pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal pinkie-winkie!
pinkie pound cake?  here, pound cake!
pinkie [wind blowing]
pinkie uh, pound cake? uh...
pinkie you can fly?!
pinkie oh- get down here- this instant- young- colt! [gasps for breath] i'm responsible for you!
pinkie [plunger noises]
pinkie [magic noises]
pinkie no no no, pumpkin.
pinkie no no.
pinkie no. hmph! i am the responsible one, and i said no.
pinkie that goes for you too, pound cake!
pinkie gotcha! i think? [lots of whoa!s, ows, etc]
pinkie [banging on stairs]
pinkie mm, razzleberry. i'm- not- letting- go! i'm- re-spon-si-ble!
pinkie [banging on stairs]
pinkie [elastic stretching]
pinkie oh, not you too! there! now who's the responsible one?
pinkie y'know, you're right. that is funny.
pinkie dear princess celestia, i've always had fun playing with little kids, and i thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? wrong! being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. and today i learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
pinkie [bell rings]
pinkie shhh!
pinkie hm- ah- lemme check my schedule! i should be available a week from... never!
pinkie [happily gasps] i have some free time next tuesday.
pinkie speech! speech!
pinkie alright then, no speech!
pinkie and have fun. and don't be nervous. or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! and eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy and taffy gives lots of nervous energy! 
pinkie and drink sarsaparilla! what? it gives you extra sass.
pinkie surprise!
pinkie sorry! i was just practicing my âsurprise!â for when we surprise applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champion of equestria! surprise!

pinkie [door shuts]
pinkie do you have any snacks?
pinkie that's it? well, that's a terrible story!
pinkie what?! she had beans? ugh, i told her i was snacky!
pinkie hey applejack. need some help?
pinkie i promise.
pinkie have you ever had a cherry changa? ooh! sorry, that was a question.
pinkie well no wonder, because i made it up myself! a cherry changa is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. cherrychanga. great name, huh? oh, but maybe i should call it a chimicherry. ooh, that's good too. which do you think sounds better? cherrychanga or chimicherry? or what if i combine them? chimicherrychanga! what sounds the funniest? i like funny words! one of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! i didn't make that one up. i would work in a kumquat orchard just so i could say 'kumquat' all day! kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! and 'pickle barrel'! isn't that just the funnest thing to say? pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel. say it with me! pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!
pinkie [continues chant, muffled by rainbow dash]
pinkie speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... [continues under]
pinkie do you pinkie promise?
pinkie don't worry, rainbow. she's gotta 'fess up after making a pinkie promise.
pinkie good morning, applejack. you ready for br- 
pinkie [sound of kettle boiling]

pinkie get them! get them!
pinkie applejack, you broke your pinkie promise! apologize!

pinkie well i heard a sorry in there, so that'll have to do for now. i'll get a real apology later. rarity, catch me.
pinkie what do you think, rarity? chimicherry, or cherrychanga? chimicherry, cherrychanga? chimicherry, cherrychanga? chimicherry, cherrychanga? chimicherry, cherrychanga? [continues under]
pinkie [continues repeating question to fadeout]
pinkie isn't this great? i couldn't sleep last night 'cause i was so excited about cider season, and i had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so i told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too and now it's just a big old cider party! woohoo! oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies. hope they don't run out before you get any.
pinkie she's right, y'know! you can't rush perfection! and this year's batch was perfection!
pinkie i'll never forget the cider i just drank! it was a moment in time that will never exist again...
pinkie non-pa what?
pinkie yes sir, ma'am, sir!
pinkie over there, apple bloom! don't miss them!

pinkie uh, we'll see you tomorrow, rainbow dash, aheh...
pinkie [door closes]
pinkie hey, nopony invited me!

pinkie he's starting to warm up, but still no smile. hmmm.
pinkie hey! whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
pinkie looks like a yard sale. i'll give you two bits for this!
pinkie well, why didn't you say so?
pinkie this is so pretty! where'd you get it?
pinkie really? what were you doin' there?
pinkie oooh, i'm always trying to find friends, and today i found you. see how good i am at it?
pinkie like me?
pinkie [to herself] yes. i'm in. [to cranky] woow, where in equestria did you get this, cranky?
pinkie it's awfully pretty.
pinkie huh?
pinkie i wonder where cranky got this. huh. will you look at that? hey, cranky! can i ask you about-
pinkie oh no!
pinkie there! uh, all better?
pinkie i'm sorry, cranky!
pinkie ...it is?
pinkie never, or never-ever?
pinkie that's four 'ever's. that's like... forever!
pinkie i just can't believe it. cranky said he would never forever be my friend. it was horrible.
pinkie no, no, it's okay, twilight. i get what you're saying. what you're both saying. and i guess... i can leave cranky alone. ...right after he accepts my apology!
pinkie cranky!
pinkie wait! i understand that you don't want me as a friend!
pinkie so i just wanted to say 'i'm sorry'!
pinkie but do you accept my apology?
pinkie oh cranky! please accept my apology! please!
pinkie but i'm really, really, really...
pinkie ...really, really-
pinkie [engines revving]
pinkie ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really really really... [continues saying âreallyâ, speed increases until] ...sorry!
pinkie [sound of locks and chains]
pinkie [six knocks]
pinkie cranky, please, please accept my apology! i'd do anything to make it up to you!
pinkie her? her who? the special friend?
pinkie cranky? it's me again. i understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... before i leave you alone forever, i have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
pinkie you didn't have to. i put two and two and two together and it added up to matilda.
pinkie well when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! and y'know, i wasn't just born yesterday, nuh-uh! my birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
pinkie and then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the grand galloping gala! and i knew i recognized all these things.
pinkie and i'd seen them in matilda's book!
pinkie uh. matilda? nopony calls him doodle...
pinkie so does this mean that you accept my apology?
pinkie [explodes like a firework] woohoo! this is just fantastic! ooh, now we can hang out together, and chat, and sing songs, and  party! oh, i can throw you guys a big party! it'll be called a 'welcome to ponyville, i found my lost love, i'm bff's with pinkie pie party'! ...or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
pinkie oh. um, but we're still friends?
pinkie great!
pinkie dear princess celestia, there are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. some friends like to run and laugh and play together. but others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. but the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
pinkie he had a cranky doodle sweetheart
pinkie she's his cranky doodle joy
pinkie i helped the cranky doodle boy, yeah!
pinkie i helped the cranky doodle boy!
pinkie whoops, privacy. sorry.
pinkie [yankee doodle dandy plays over credits]
pinkie it's bigger than big, it's double big, you are a pony with a problem.
pinkie right there! that's the problem.
pinkie what do you think you're doing?
pinkie two bits for tomatoes is outrageous, one bit is the right price.
pinkie one bit.
pinkie one bit!
pinkie one bit!
pinkie two bits!
pinkie two bits!
pinkie i insist it's two bits or nothing!
pinkie have it your way, one bit it is!
pinkie see? asserting yourself can be fun!
pinkie don't give him your money! one cherry is not worth twelve bits!
pinkie who's next, please, and what can i get for you today?
pinkie heyyy, look at you!
pinkie looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
pinkie well, old pinkie pie feels really proud of new fluttershy. proud as pink punch. want some? 
pinkie old pinkie pie is not so sure new fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
pinkie new fluttershy... old fluttershy...!?
pinkie nyaaaaah! too many fluttershies to keep track of! make it stop!
pinkie hey, leave her alone! fashion is her passion!
pinkie [starts crying] looks like nasty fluttershy is here to stay!
pinkie it's pinkie pie, and rarity!
pinkie we did?
pinkie yeah! he's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. what i mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
pinkie no, but he is.
pinkie fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
pinkie we're not even sure fluttershy is home right now. uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures, uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
pinkie but that's only half a day. we need one full day at least.
pinkie a full day!
pinkie full day!
pinkie half day!
pinkie we need half a day and no more!
pinkie okie dokie. see you tomorrow.
pinkie but we had an agreement! you gotta come back tomorrow!
pinkie [goat munching]
pinkie you were amazing, fluttershy! you totally stood up to that monster!
pinkie the one we missed!
pinkie friends.
pinkie c'mon, fluttershy! the party can't start until the party supplies get there!
pinkie run for your liiiiiiiife!
pinkie anypony else wanna panic with me? no? [resumes screaming]
pinkie okay everypony, follow my lead. 
pinkie [stops screaming] yes, twilight?
pinkie i have balls stashed all over ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
pinkie come... enter the chamber of madame pinkie pie... for the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny...  do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? i just got it. cool, huh?
pinkie look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! ah yes, i see something... it is a vision of the future... i see... you, twilight. you will get a really cool birthday present next year...
pinkie that's it.
pinkie yep. cool birthday present.
pinkie oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do with my pinkie sense, silly. it's only good for vague and immediate events.
pinkie like that, see? where did that even come from?
pinkie lalalalalalala, lalalala... gosh, i haven't seen twilight since the flowerpot incident. hope she still isn't mad. uhhhh...
pinkie [papers rustling]
pinkie twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
pinkie [to twilight] are... you okay?
pinkie sure!
pinkie nice!
pinkie makes sense to me!
pinkie three hours? but when did you sleep?
pinkie yeah. tuesday's not three days from now, tuesday's tomorrow!
pinkie i have no idea!
pinkie don't worry, twilight, i have eye patches stashed all over ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. there! now you look like a pirate! a sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
pinkie aren't we wearing them for fun?
pinkie oh... are you sure?
pinkie awesome! that sounds fun!
pinkie aww.
pinkie [ripping sound]
pinkie i still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
pinkie cool! can we climb in the window again? that was super fun!
pinkie maybe we should ask somepony in the star swirl the bearded wing?
pinkie [orchestral twang]
pinkie [angelic choir]
pinkie twilight, the guard!
pinkie oh!
pinkie and that's bad, right?
pinkie twilight, twilight, i found something! it doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. it says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. does that help?
pinkie woohoo!
pinkie did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
pinkie ah, don't worry about it. it's past twilight's problem now.
pinkie me neither neither.
pinkie ahoy, maties! dragons ho!
pinkie and 'super-duper scary'!
pinkie oh, not even close!
pinkie yeah, twilight, i mean listen to this one. âmayor, not naturally gray!â the mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? who wouldn't wanna read that?
pinkie what?!  it's true! i do have a problem!
pinkie marzipan mascarpone meringue madness. you've really outdone yourselves, mr. and mrs. cake. this is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
pinkie absolutely! it's my honor and i-
pinkie alrighty then big mac! to the train depot! that's it big mac, nice and slow. this is precious cargo you're carrying.
pinkie don't worry mr. and mrs. cake. rainbow dash, fluttershy, a little pegassistance? i'll get it there safely, you'll see!
pinkie twilight, can i see you a second? a nice protective spell as extra insurance , better safe than sorry. aj, rarity, one last thing? all right everypony, we're in the home stretch here. see mr. and mrs. cake? i got it here without a hitch! now all we have to do is get it... in?
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/theme_song" title="theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
pinkie thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
pinkie well the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the cakes' marzipan mascarpone meringue madness. all that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. that's why i call the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness the "mmmm".
pinkie exactly. it's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
pinkie hello. what's your name?
pinkie the cakes' marzipan mascarpone meringue madness is going to win!
pinkie wait! didn't you hear those chefs? we have to protect "mmmm."
pinkie mmm hmmm. i know for super sure that "mmmm" is the best dessert in all of equestria, and i know that they know it too.
pinkie so... one of them is going to sabotage the cakes' cake tonight! you have to help me stand guard!
pinkie but they are! i just know it.
pinkie i'll show them. i'll stay up all night and protect you. nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
pinkie huh? stop you saboteur! i have you now! wha? a-ha! ahh? oh! thank celestia you're okay! but one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so i'm not leaving you again no matter what.
pinkie [blinds snap shut]
pinkie huh? who turned out the moon? don't go near that cake, thief!
pinkie stop thief!
pinkie oh, are you okay thief?  huh... overreacting my hoof. i knew i was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what i'm gonna do. 
pinkie [rooster crow]
pinkie huh? what?  the cake! oh mmmm, you look mmmm-marvelous.
pinkie i know. i think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
pinkie look at what? huh? 
pinkie it's the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness, it's been  mutilated.
pinkie now we just need to find out who done it.
pinkie exactly. who did-done-dood it.
pinkie exactly.
pinkie and as chief detective, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
pinkie yes! and twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
pinkie perfect silly question, my dear twilight. because the obvious answer is...
pinkie no! 'cause i know who did it.
pinkie how could i possibly not know? clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness. i guess you feared your Ã©clairs lacked flair, gustave!
pinkie [silent film music]
pinkie thus, destroying the cake, and the cakes' chance of winning the national dessert competition.
pinkie what do you mean, lowly assistant?
pinkie huh... guess that isn't a totally silly question.
pinkie hm... you're right, my fine fellow. gustave le grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "mmmm" was destroyed by another baker. a baker who's donuts are do-nots. that's right, it was joe!
pinkie [spy music]
pinkie or as he's known the spy world, mane. con mane.
pinkie [spraying noise]
pinkie [laser noise]
pinkie crushing the cakes' chances to win!
pinkie huh... you may be right, lowly assistant.
pinkie now that i'm taking a closer look at these desserts, i see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
pinkie yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the "mmmm".
pinkie mulia mild!
pinkie [ninja sounds]
pinkie [cutting sounds]
pinkie putting an end to the cakes' dreams of taking first prize. huh, i hope you're proud of yourself mulia.
pinkie i guess you're right...
pinkie but i was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "mmmm". that way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. i mean, just look at joe's donutopia. it's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. and gustave's Ã©clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. but then there's mulia mild's mousse moose. hoh, why this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. so why did this criminal devour the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
pinkie [munching sounds]
pinkie now i have no idea who do-doned it!
pinkie this mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
pinkie huh! you're not accusing me, are you?
pinkie i saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
pinkie and then, i chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when i got there he was gone.
pinkie already?
pinkie i heard somepony else in the dessert car, and chased them up to the engine. but, when i got there, all i saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
pinkie well... i went back to the dessert car.
pinkie the curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
pinkie i heard hoofsteps, a loud thud, and then they were gone! when i opened the curtains, i saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
pinkie that's it. i was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. i mean... i slept by the cake the rest of the night.
pinkie exactly.
pinkie a-ha! a blue feather. i knew it was you, gustave le grand.
pinkie no, 'cause he's been dying them!
pinkie so rainbow dash did it! case solved!
pinkie so it was you, that pink hair came from your rainbow colored mane!
pinkie so you're wearing a wig?
pinkie [stretching noises]
pinkie you're goin' down, fluttershy.
pinkie that's okay. at least this mystery is finally solved.
pinkie you're right twilight. you know what we have to do?
pinkie look for clues! uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
pinkie i most certainly did. it was, none other than, the bakers!
pinkie first of all, gustave has mousse in his moustache, and joe has Ã©clair in his hair, and mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
pinkie i think we can fix that. come on!
pinkie dear princess celestia, today i learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. you have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. if you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. this could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. so from now on, i will always make sure to get all the facts.
pinkie how's that for a lesson, princess celestia?
pinkie i don't mind if i do.
pinkie [munching sounds]
pinkie mmmmm.
pinkie hip, hip, hooray!
pinkie best wedding ever!
pinkie we're here, we're here!
pinkie aaaaaaaaa- [sneezes like a trumpet]
pinkie okay, let me see. we've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...
pinkie [polka from swarm of the century plays]
pinkie i think this reception is gonna be perfect! don't you?
pinkie thank you!
pinkie [kissing noises and laughing]
pinkie rarity!
pinkie do me! do me! meh, i've seen better.
pinkie [fly flying sounds]
pinkie let's get this party started!
pinkie are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with princess celestia?
pinkie time to gather some intel!
pinkie because it isn't!
pinkie aaaah!
