pinkie [prolonged gasp]
pinkie Surprise! Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?
pinkie Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all "hello" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!
pinkie And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!
pinkie [kettle whistling]
pinkie Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
pinkie [with mouth full] What? It's good!
pinkie [muffled disco music]
pinkie [clock ticking]
pinkie Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited- well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?
pinkie 
pinkie Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
pinkie Ooh, she's good. 
pinkie [ponies gasping]
pinkie Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty-[muffled noises]
pinkie 
pinkie "The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide."
pinkie [sing-song voice] It was under "E"!
pinkie Whee! Let's go!
pinkie Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
pinkie 
pinkie  Bleh. Ooo! [funny noises]
pinkie Oh girls, don't you see?
pinkie [>Pinkie Pie]
pinkie When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
pinkie The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown
pinkie I'd hide under my pillow
pinkie From what I thought I saw
pinkie But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
pinkie To deal with fears at all
pinkie She said: "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
pinkie Learn to face your fears
pinkie You'll see that they can't hurt you
pinkie Just laugh to make them disappear."
pinkie Ha! Ha! Ha!
pinkie So, giggle at the ghostly
pinkie Guffaw at the grossly
pinkie Crack up at the creepy
pinkie Whoop it up with the weepy
pinkie Chortle at the kooky
pinkie Snortle at the spooky
pinkie And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha...heh...
pinkie Laaaaaaauuugh!
pinkie 
pinkie How are we gonna cross this?
pinkie [distant cry]
pinkie Huh?
pinkie  Now what?
pinkie Oh yeah.
pinkie One, two, three, four... There's only five!
pinkie Look at mine! Look at mine!
pinkie Whoa!
pinkie [blows her nose]  Hey, you know what this calls for?
pinkie A party!
pinkie [music and cheering ponies]
pinkie Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went  but I mean really-
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie  Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala? It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!
pinkie [>Pinkie Pie]
pinkie Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
pinkie Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
pinkie Hip hip
pinkie Hooray
pinkie It's the best place for me
pinkie For Pinkie...
pinkie With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and piñatas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
pinkie Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
pinkie Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
pinkie 'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever
pinkie In the whole galaxy
pinkie Wheee!
pinkie Oh thank you Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever.
pinkie Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to The Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.
pinkie Him! ...Who?
pinkie You haven't?
pinkie But Twilight's taking me.
pinkie [ponies argue]
pinkie [ponies argue]
pinkie And then I said, "Oatmeal, are you craz--" oh.
pinkie Twilight is my bestest friend
pinkie Whoopie, whoopie!
pinkie She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!
pinkie I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!
pinkie She'll give her extra ticket to the gala to me!
pinkie Yes, Twilight?
pinkie Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!
pinkie And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
pinkie And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me.
pinkie  Hey...!  This makes my voice sound silly!
pinkie This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.
pinkie Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!
pinkie Appletastic!
pinkie I know.
pinkie A party!
pinkie Not since the stampede.
pinkie This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
pinkie Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
pinkie [ponies cheering]
pinkie Woo-ooo.
pinkie She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
pinkie Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?
pinkie Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.
pinkie Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
pinkie Chocolate chips.
pinkie Baking soda.
pinkie A cup of flour.
pinkie One last thing. Wheat germ.
pinkie Now that's gonna be delicious.
pinkie Free muffin sample spectacular!
pinkie [ponies: mmm, muffins]
pinkie No, not baked goods, baked bads. 
pinkie Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?
pinkie Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!
pinkie And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo.
pinkie Rainbow Dash!
pinkie Rainbow Dash.
pinkie But, but Rainbow Dash–
pinkie But–
pinkie I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
pinkie  Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?
pinkie Rainbow Dash.
pinkie Hi!
pinkie Hi again.
pinkie Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
pinkie I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
pinkie Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the--
pinkie Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal.
pinkie  Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups.
pinkie Oh no, you're not hurt are you?
pinkie Oh, okay, good.
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Have you ever seen anything more hilarious? 
pinkie Aah!       
pinkie Are you  kidding?  I love to pull pranks. It's all  in good fun, and Pinkie Pie lo----oves to have  fun! 
pinkie 
pinkie  That'd be  I'd really  When do  I mean  When would you 
pinkie Mmm-hmm.
pinkie I don't know. This is gonna be gold.
pinkie 
pinkie Aaa-choo!
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie [water splash]
pinkie Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
pinkie WHAT?  Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.
pinkie Oh,  I've got someone in mind.  The toughest around.
pinkie  Oh, yes.  You're very close.
pinkie 
pinkie What's a griffon?
pinkie  Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?
pinkie Oh. Um, well sure, no problem. Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you--  later. (blows a party hooter very sadly)
pinkie Hey there.
pinkie It's later. And I caught up.
pinkie Hey!
pinkie Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
pinkie Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
pinkie Yeah?
pinkie  Whaaa-aaa–
pinkie Hmph!
pinkie Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.
pinkie Hmm?
pinkie Jealous?
pinkie Improve my attitude? But I... D... B.. It's Gilda that... D... Are you seri... [scream of frustration]
pinkie Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. 
pinkie Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.&#160;:>Gilda
pinkie 
pinkie  I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.
pinkie She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.
pinkie Welcome, welcome. Welcome!
pinkie Welcome. Welcome.
pinkie Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
pinkie Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Great.
pinkie  Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
pinkie And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
pinkie [ponies cheer]
pinkie Please help yourself.
pinkie Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
pinkie You do?
pinkie [ponies chatter, birds singing]
pinkie Cake time everypony.
pinkie Now, I wonder who could've done that.
pinkie Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
pinkie Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.
pinkie We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
pinkie Wait. The poster is this--
pinkie Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
pinkie [ponies laugh]
pinkie Ooh.
pinkie I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
pinkie Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
pinkie Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
pinkie No hard feelings.
pinkie 
pinkie It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.
pinkie [ponies cheer]
pinkie This calls for a celebration!
pinkie Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
pinkie Let's see, that's one, two, three, four...
pinkie Five, six...
pinkie Seven.
pinkie Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!
pinkie Huh?
pinkie He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
pinkie  Oh, I mean, grrr!
pinkie Ooo! Pretty!
pinkie Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!
pinkie [pop whistles]
pinkie Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!
pinkie Whoo-hoo! I win again!
pinkie There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?
pinkie It's not very far
pinkie Just move your little rump
pinkie You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump
pinkie A hop, skip and jump,
pinkie Just move your little rump,
pinkie A hop, skip and jump,
pinkie A hop, skip and jump,
pinkie A hop, skip and jump,
pinkie A hop skip and jump,
pinkie A hop skip and jump!
pinkie Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
pinkie 
pinkie Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
pinkie 
pinkie Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing.
pinkie [busted horn]
pinkie 
pinkie Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
pinkie Z-Zombie pony?!
pinkie I'm not alone in the dark.
pinkie Glance evilly this way.
pinkie And spoooooky!
pinkie And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil...stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
pinkie She's an evil enchantress
pinkie She does evil dances
pinkie And if you look deep in her eyes
pinkie She'll put you in trances
pinkie Then what will she do?
pinkie She'll mix up an evil brew
pinkie Then she'll gobble you up
pinkie In a big tasty stew
pinkie Soooo.... Watch out!
pinkie It's a work in progress.
pinkie Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
pinkie Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
pinkie Just like in my song! [Starts singing a shorter version of "Evil Enchantress"]
pinkie She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
pinkie If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
pinkie Then what will she do?
pinkie Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo watch out!
pinkie Ah pfurse!
pinkie Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
pinkie Ah am-pft!
pinkie Pf-she's gone-pft!
pinkie Nopthe.
pinkie Plis place plooks horrible!
pinkie Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
pinkie Ah. Hmm... Pbth! 
pinkie  You made me speak ridiculous!
pinkie Oh my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean I love talking so much and when I couldn't talk 'cause my tongue was all 'ehhhh'. It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?
pinkie Mmm... 
pinkie Aaaaa... I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
pinkie No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home.  What's going on, Fluttershy?
pinkie UGH! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
pinkie Ugh. Now I gotta find a trombone.
pinkie A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
pinkie Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
pinkie Gals! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
pinkie Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?
pinkie  And not a moment too soon.
pinkie And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
pinkie You've got a real problem alright, and a banjo is the only answer.
pinkie Twilight, we don't have much time.
pinkie Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
pinkie  You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!
pinkie And you are all so stubborn.
pinkie They will be with these cymbals.  Hey! Give me those back!
pinkie I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
pinkie Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruinee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
pinkie Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you just slow down and listen to me!
pinkie Look, tambourines! If you could all just...  [tambourines shake]
pinkie I'll save you!
pinkie 
pinkie Hey, what happened to the princess?
pinkie Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
pinkie Well DUH, why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
pinkie Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
pinkie We've kept our hoovsies warm at home
pinkie Time off from work to play
pinkie When the sun comes up
pinkie Its warmth and beauty will glow!
pinkie 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
pinkie Helooooooo Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!
pinkie Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
pinkie Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?
pinkie Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.
pinkie Yaaaaay! 
pinkie Yippie!
pinkie Twilight, steer! Steer!
pinkie Oh boy...
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
pinkie No.
pinkie But did I make you feel better?
pinkie I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hoofs on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
pinkie Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
pinkie You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
pinkie Eating cupcaaakes!
pinkie I don't have any cupcakes.
pinkie  But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
pinkie [>Pinkie Pie]
pinkie All you have to do is take a cup of flour!
pinkie Add it to the mix!
pinkie Now just take a little something sweet, not sour!
pinkie A bit of salt, just a pinch!
pinkie Baking these treats is such a cinch!
pinkie Add a teaspoon of vanilla!
pinkie Add a little more, and you count to four,
pinkie And you never get your fill of...
pinkie Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
pinkie Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
pinkie Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!
pinkie Oooh, those look much better than the last batch.  Mmm...
pinkie What about that?
pinkie  Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo.
pinkie We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
pinkie Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!
pinkie Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
pinkie As everypony knows, the running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.
pinkie Racers! Please take your positions!
pinkie Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it me, I'm up!
pinkie What?
pinkie Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
pinkie Climb on up.
pinkie All right, ponies, are you ready?
pinkie And they're off!
pinkie Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to My Little Ponies.
pinkie Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
pinkie Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
pinkie And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
pinkie Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck in neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash pulls at Applejack's have-it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... Roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
pinkie What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
pinkie She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.
pinkie Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.
pinkie I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?
pinkie Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
pinkie Applejack, what are you doing up here?
pinkie I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!
pinkie But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
pinkie Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck in neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack--
pinkie Oh yes, she di'id!
pinkie It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--
pinkie For last.
pinkie I love something! Something is my favorite!
pinkie Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?
pinkie Balloons?
pinkie DO IT!
pinkie More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
pinkie Whose dress is this?
pinkie All we ever want is indecision
pinkie Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
pinkie I don't believe it!
pinkie Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
pinkie She'll become a crazy cat lady!
pinkie Give her time.
pinkie We all finished your dress for you.
pinkie We're so super sorry.
pinkie Ooh!
pinkie Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
pinkie Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
pinkie The twichin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You should better duck for cover.
pinkie He just said, "nice catch" in Frog.
pinkie [frog croaks]
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
pinkie Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
pinkie Nah! I could just see it.
pinkie [Pinkie Pie skips away singing]
pinkie My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
pinkie It's okay, my tail stopped twitching.
pinkie [Pinkie Pie begins skipping away singing]
pinkie My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
pinkie I'll start a bath for you.
pinkie Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggling feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
pinkie No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub.
pinkie 
pinkie No it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!
pinkie What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?
pinkie That's so not true Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em "combos".
pinkie Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
pinkie Uh oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
pinkie 
pinkie Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay?
pinkie You don't believe because you don't understand.
pinkie Okey-dokey-lokey!
pinkie [steam stack whistling periodically]
pinkie Nopey-dopey!
pinkie Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no.
pinkie I don't control it, they just come and go.
pinkie Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
pinkie Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...
pinkie It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
pinkie Okey-dokey-lokey.  Uh-oh.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu [falls over backwards]
pinkie 
pinkie Uh-huh.
pinkie   Mmm... 
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie  Hey, Applejack. Whatchya doin'?
pinkie Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day, without me knowing.
pinkie  Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
pinkie All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell-- Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And its gonna happen... At Froggy Bottom Bog!
pinkie Uh, I'm not sure.
pinkie Okey-dokey!
pinkie [gate creaks]
pinkie [frogs croak]
pinkie  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie No thanks, I'm fine.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
pinkie Woah!
pinkie What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?
pinkie Fluttershy? 
pinkie I'm so glad everything's alright.
pinkie Is that a hydra!?
pinkie 
pinkie Ooph! 
pinkie Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n.
pinkie [ponies gasp]
pinkie Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
pinkie T-t-t-twilight!
pinkie [hydra chirps]
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie [ponies gasp]
pinkie [hydra roars]
pinkie T-t-t-twilight! You have to jump!
pinkie You'll be fine!
pinkie Its your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
pinkie I knew you could do it, Twilight!
pinkie 
pinkie That wasn't it.
pinkie The hydra wasn't the doozy.
pinkie [Hydra spits]
pinkie I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
pinkie Dunno, but it just wasn't it.
pinkie [kettle whistles]
pinkie Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
pinkie Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. Ooh!  That was it. That's the doozy.
pinkie You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was!
pinkie [Pinkie Pie skips off, singing]
pinkie 
pinkie Honk!
pinkie There it goes again.
pinkie You never know.
pinkie [jet engine sound]
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Woah, woah, WooooaaAAAAHH!
pinkie OOH! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean COME ON! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!
pinkie You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going soo fast... BOOM! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
pinkie Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
pinkie A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
pinkie It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
pinkie Sure did!
pinkie Haha. Pretty cool, huh?
pinkie Yes!
pinkie  Spicyyyyyy!...
pinkie 
pinkie We still love you.
pinkie Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
pinkie Ow!
pinkie Wait for me! Wheee!
pinkie I can't believe you got all these gems!
pinkie Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
pinkie  We won't say a word!
pinkie Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
pinkie FOREVER!
pinkie How'd it go? How'd it go?
pinkie FOREVER!
pinkie FOREVER!
pinkie Mmm... Juicy!
pinkie [(Shows using gestures) Zipping her mouth, locking it with the key, digging a hole, burring the key in that hole, building a house atop that hole and moving into that house.]
pinkie Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house up top the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house atop the hole.
pinkie  And you were doing so well.
pinkie Awwww!
pinkie  No, are you asleep yet?
pinkie  Oh yeah! 
pinkie  What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
pinkie  Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
pinkie Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
pinkie She's not a tree, Dashy!
pinkie Oooh, looky! Now they're doing TRICKS!
pinkie Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a back-flip!... Or... Just jump?
pinkie Boo!
pinkie Ah'ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're goood.
pinkie I do?
pinkie I am?
pinkie Oh my gosh, so am I!
pinkie Mmm!  Before we finish EATING? Are you loco in the coco?!
pinkie Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?
pinkie Huh?
pinkie Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
pinkie Hi guys!
pinkie We didn't!
pinkie Hey! I've got an idea!
pinkie We may be divided
pinkie But of you all, I beg
pinkie To remember we're all hoofed
pinkie At the end of each leg
pinkie No matter what the issue
pinkie Come from wherever you please
pinkie All this fighting gets you nothing
pinkie But hoof and mouth disease
pinkie Arguing's not the way
pinkie Hey, come out and play!
pinkie It's a shiny, new day
pinkie So, what do you say?
pinkie You gotta share
pinkie You gotta care
pinkie It's the right thing to do
pinkie You gotta share
pinkie You gotta care
pinkie And there'll always be a way through
pinkie Both our diets, I should mention
pinkie Are completely vegetarian
pinkie We all eat hay and oats
pinkie Why be at each other's throat?
pinkie You gotta share
pinkie You gotta care
pinkie It's the right thing to do
pinkie And there'll always be a way
pinkie Thro-o-o-o-ugh!
pinkie Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
pinkie Wah-ahh! Woah-oo-oo-oo-ooah!
pinkie HEY! That's what I said!
pinkie 
pinkie Cookies, candies and pies, oh my! [pie in the face] Oooh! Chocolate Fountainy goodness! [Head in choclate fountain, choclate hardens and eats it] You gonna eat that?! Hey!
pinkie Hi!
pinkie 
pinkie [Philomena bursts into flames]
pinkie No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?
pinkie You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
pinkie Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
pinkie Alright!
pinkie My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville. We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling.  There were only rocks. We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden...
pinkie 
pinkie I never felt joy like that before. It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever. And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?
pinkie And that's how Equestria was made.
pinkie Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
pinkie I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
pinkie We all owe our cutie marks to you!
pinkie I love you, guys!
pinkie Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
pinkie Mmm. Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!
pinkie And now the punch has been... spiked!
pinkie Oh, what a fantastical, fluffelicious feathery little friend! I'm... HOOked!
pinkie [everybody laughs]
pinkie I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!
pinkie Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche! [pronounced phonetically]
pinkie Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
pinkie [rasping voice] Next time, I think I’ll just pass out written invitations.
pinkie &#8203;&#91;&#8203;<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>&#8203;&#93;&#8203;
pinkie Hey, girls!
pinkie  Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you can make it to Gummy’s party.
pinkie Aw! It’s just a boring old apple. Don’t worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
pinkie I can’t tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn’t be a surprise.
pinkie Nope! Something new. It’s Gummy’s favorite. Ooh, this is my jam!
pinkie Having fun?
pinkie They’re always the best parties ’cause my best friends are always there! C’mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It’s your birthday! Go, Gummy! It’s your birthday!
pinkie You sure you don’t wanna stay? There’s still some cake left.
pinkie  We should do this again soon!
pinkie It’s soon!
pinkie You said we should have another party soon, and… it’s soon! Here’s your invitation!
pinkie All our bestest friends are invited, and there’s gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
pinkie Yes, indeedy!
pinkie I understand. Your studies come first. But don’t worry, we’ll be sure to save you some cake.
pinkie Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn’t hit the books. You should really just read them.
pinkie Who’s ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It’s an invitation to “Gummy’s After-Birthday” party this afternoon. There’s gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
pinkie That’s funny. That’s just what Twilight said, and the answer is, “Yes! It’s this afternoon!”
pinkie Okey dokey lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.
pinkie Gummy’s after-birthday party is this afternoon. I’m delivering the invitations.
pinkie It’s so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
pinkie I know it’s short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
pinkie Don’t be silly, your hair doesn’t look dirty.
pinkie Nope!
pinkie Huh… No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.
pinkie Yes! As in, this afternoon this afternoon!
pinkie  Both of you?
pinkie Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who’re you house-sitting for?
pinkie Harry?
pinkie That’s strange. I know just about everypony around here.
pinkie A bear?
pinkie Wait! There’s a bear around here who lives in a house?
pinkie He’s vacationing at the beach?
pinkie Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies, and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like…  excuses!
pinkie That doesn’t look like studying… or hitting!
pinkie But… we’re friends. What wouldn’t Twilight want me to know anything about?  She's coming back.
pinkie Time to get to the bottom of things!  I think our cover’s been blown! We’ll need a new disguise.
pinkie I thought everypony loved my parties.
pinkie Rainbow Dash! Wait!
pinkie Where’re you going?!
pinkie What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
pinkie What's in those bags?!
pinkie I know you're IN THERE!
pinkie Mind if I… take a look inside the barn?
pinkie Rainbow Dash just went in there.
pinkie Okey… dokey… lokey.
pinkie Secrets and lies! It’s all secrets and lies with those ponies! They’re up to something, Gummy! Something they don’t want me to know about! Well, I’m gonna know about it! I’m gonna know about it big time! And I know just who’s gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it BIG TIME!
pinkie It’s all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk.
pinkie No, no, no. Talk about our friends.
pinkie Grr! No! You’re not understanding me! I want you to confess!
pinkie Confess!
pinkie And?
pinkie Aaand?
pinkie No! No! No! NO!
pinkie Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don’t like my parties, and they don't want to be my friends anymore! 
pinkie Ah-ha! I knew it! [balloon deflating noise] Oh no, my friends don’t like my parties and they don’t want to be my friends anymore.
pinkie 
pinkie Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
pinkie Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr. Turnip. 
pinkie Why, thank you, Rocky.
pinkie I’m so glad Sir Lintsalot. 
pinkie Anything for you, Madame Le Flour
pinkie Oh, they’re not so bad.
pinkie [low string instrument whine]
pinkie Oh, c’mon now. “Losers” might be a little strong, don’cha think?
pinkie Well, it was pretty rude...
pinkie It was, wasn’t it?
pinkie You know what? I’m not gonna speak to them ever again. And I’m not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don’t deserve to be invited to my parties.  Not after the way they’ve been acting.
pinkie Who could that be?
pinkie I know how it goes, all right!
pinkie No thanks. I’m spending time with my real friends. Isn’t that right, Madame Le Flour?'
pinkie Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
pinkie I most certainly am not. I’m having a wonderful time right here.
pinkie No!
pinkie I said, NO!
pinkie No… I… DON’T!
pinkie Excited? EXCITED? Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
pinkie Yes! You don’t like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A “Farewell to Pinkie Pie” party!
pinkie Why? Why? WHY? Because you’ve been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that’s why!
pinkie  Because it’s my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgot my own birthday?
pinkie [ponies sigh in relief]
pinkie And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
pinkie You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
pinkie You girls wouldn’t mind if we celebrated Gummy’s after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he’s pretty upset about it.
pinkie Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
pinkie What's Twilight doing?
pinkie An apple! Are we having pie?
pinkie Busy having fun!
pinkie I am here at the Grand Gala, for it is the best party
pinkie But the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie
pinkie For I am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree
pinkie Ponies playing, ponies dancing, with me at the Grand Gala!
pinkie To whoop!
pinkie The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy! [anxious noise] GOTTA DANCE!
pinkie [sings to the tune of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow]
pinkie I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
pinkie I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
pinkie I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
pinkie It's all I ever dreamed.
pinkie It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo!
pinkie It's all I ever dreamed, yippee!
pinkie I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!
pinkie 
pinkie It's all I ever... dreamed?
pinkie I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.
pinkie And I'm not going to...
pinkie  
pinkie C'mon everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!
pinkie That's what I'm talking about
pinkie You do the Pony Pokey
pinkie You do the Pony Pokey
pinkie You do the Pony Pokey
pinkie And that's what it's all about
pinkie Yeah!
pinkie Ooooooh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!
pinkie Come on, everypony! You wanted a partey? Now it's paaarteeey! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!
pinkie STAGE DIVE!
pinkie Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you.
pinkie Laughing!
pinkie In fact, it's made it...
pinkie Why would you wanna stop this? 
pinkie Hey, what happened?
pinkie You and me both, sister! Hey!
pinkie Hey, look! We're famous!
pinkie Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!
pinkie Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
pinkie 
pinkie  He's standing on your head!
pinkie See you guys there!
pinkie 
pinkie  Whee! This is the greatest balloon garden I've ever seen! It's the first balloon garden I've ever seen, but still! Wah!
pinkie Hey, what gives?
pinkie It's different. They're laughing at me.
pinkie My friends laugh with me, not at me.
pinkie No! Stop it!
pinkie Stop laughing at me!
pinkie Happy? I don't think so.
pinkie [balloons popping]
pinkie Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?
pinkie And what are you laughing at?
pinkie Why? Need a good laugh?
pinkie And what are you laughing at?
pinkie Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!
pinkie Quit it!
pinkie Quit it!
pinkie Quit it! Stop it!
pinkie Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
pinkie What 'chu laughin' at?
pinkie This may look like fun, but it's not.
pinkie I hate libraries!
pinkie I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
pinkie It's your fault it didn't work.
pinkie Any of you! To ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
pinkie  And I-I turned gray!  Can you believe it?!
pinkie Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
pinkie WHOA!
pinkie Oops.
pinkie Wait-wait-wait! 
pinkie [various shock statements]
pinkie Yes?
pinkie Yes?
pinkie Yes?
pinkie [sighs of relief]
pinkie 
pinkie  Oh Twilight, you're such a crack-up! 
pinkie We're never gonna see Twilight again!
pinkie You can't punish her!
pinkie Mmhmm.
pinkie [All right, etc]
pinkie 
pinkie ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
pinkie 
pinkie [chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
pinkie Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.
pinkie Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!
pinkie Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?
pinkie And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and-[lightning zap] Bwak!
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie  Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
pinkie Ah! It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
pinkie Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
pinkie Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!
pinkie Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run... [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!
pinkie [chicken squawk]
pinkie Okay.
pinkie Mmhm. [chicken squawk]
pinkie Nightmare Moon!
pinkie ...Well, duh.
pinkie I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her. How's she gonna gobble me up?
pinkie Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared.
pinkie No, I'm not. I'm a chicken. [chicken squawk]
pinkie A party will cheer you up.
pinkie Yesterday I told Mrs Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay six! I ate six corn cakes!  Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!
pinkie 
pinkie We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.
pinkie Wait! Look!
pinkie Tortoise!
pinkie Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
pinkie You got your perfect pet, right?
pinkie You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!
pinkie You may be right...silly.
pinkie Mm-hm.
pinkie  Spike's a ghost!
pinkie I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. 
pinkie [flowerpot shatters]
pinkie It's alright.
pinkie Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. 
pinkie [yelping and screaming]
pinkie [fades in] Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she- Hi again!
pinkie Balloons are super easy to pack.
pinkie [air let out of balloons]
pinkie Isn't it fancy pants?
pinkie Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon.
pinkie 
pinkie Tada.
pinkie Let's party!
pinkie [swing music]
pinkie Mmm!
pinkie [blows party hooter] Happy birthday! Party time, woohoo!
pinkie Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
pinkie I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
pinkie [door slams]
pinkie 
pinkie Back! Get back! 
pinkie [pie splats]
pinkie I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!
pinkie How dare you take the cake!
pinkie Somepony do something!
pinkie There it is! Canterlot!
pinkie I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
pinkie [cash register kaching]
pinkie  ...and it's me!
pinkie Twilight, let me handle this.
pinkie 
pinkie Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh wait. You're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!
pinkie Well, if you non-earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas.
pinkie No, I'm first!
pinkie 
pinkie Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?
pinkie I didn't think so.
pinkie Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves – I am just about to be brilliant!
pinkie I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
pinkie Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?
pinkie Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?
pinkie 
pinkie The point is...
pinkie We must find a new land!
pinkie Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction.
pinkie But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
pinkie Of course! How else could I see where I was going?
pinkie Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?
pinkie I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down.
pinkie Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh...
pinkie Whatever. You take the map, while I enjoy some relief.
pinkie The air! The trees! The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
pinkie In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville.
pinkie Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
pinkie We found our new home!
pinkie I planted mine earlier than first.
pinkie Earth!
pinkie Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?
pinkie Uh... Smart Cookie!
pinkie Oh look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere.
pinkie Finders keepers, losers weepers!
pinkie [arguing over rock]
pinkie Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
pinkie [ice cracking]
pinkie Unicorns are snobs!
pinkie I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
pinkie Two new foals for me to play with?  That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woohoo!
pinkie But I was just-
pinkie But-
pinkie  Happy happy birthday, to you and you today-
pinkie Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!
pinkie Happy monthiversary to you and you today
pinkie [very quickly] I can't believe you're already a month old time sure flies doesn't it well it seems like only yesterday you were born.
pinkie But now you're a month old today, hey!
pinkie Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie... Here I am!
pinkie Here I am! Here I am! Here I am! [blows raspberry]
pinkie Don't worry, they're fine!  Oogh, I mean...
pinkie Ah, no thanks. I just had a big breakfast.
pinkie Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh-
pinkie All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again?
pinkie Except food.
pinkie No, you just fed them bottles, remember?
pinkie I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
pinkie Me! Me! Pick me!
pinkie I'll do it! Pick me!
pinkie I wanna babysit! Pick me!
pinkie Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!
pinkie Ask me! Mememememememememememememe!
pinkie  I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
pinkie [doors bang]
pinkie I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
pinkie Yes, I know, I will. I am.
pinkie 
pinkie Whoa! That's a lot of responsi- Consider it done.
pinkie No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Everything is under control.
pinkie Uh oh.
pinkie Oh, don't cry little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie... Where's Pinkie Pie?
pinkie Oh no... I'm right here, see!
pinkie [warbling noises]
pinkie Oh, think think think... Aha!
pinkie Hey guys, watch this!
pinkie 
pinkie Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight, where y'all from? Well that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because I couldn't find tractors that small!
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie Get it? Tractors that small?  The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog, and now I can't find him!
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie Gee, tough crowd. [to herself] Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!
pinkie First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
pinkie First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
pinkie First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
pinkie Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
pinkie 
pinkie There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!
pinkie Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie dokie! Eat up! Like this! Numnumnum, numnumnumnum! Ahh!
pinkie No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
pinkie Huh, huh? Uh hey guys, look at me!
pinkie 
pinkie Achoo!
pinkie ...yeah. I think I can see where this is going. 
pinkie [water running]
pinkie Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!
pinkie Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!?
pinkie Ooh, look guys, bubbles!
pinkie [bubble pops]
pinkie Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry, look, look, uh floating things! Ooh, aaah, eeh!
pinkie Uh, Don't make me do it, guys! You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
pinkie   [hoof on nose] Smells like somepony needs me to changie-wangie their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow! [tiptoeing noise] Easy... easy...
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie [fight sounds; >Pound Cake and >Pumpkin Cake giggling throughout]
pinkie Wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still I've almost-
pinkie Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
pinkie [bell rings]
pinkie Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
pinkie Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like, I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
pinkie [ba-dum tish]
pinkie Excuse me?
pinkie Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit, I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
pinkie Well, of all the- she thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!
pinkie Pound Cake.  This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
pinkie And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!
pinkie  [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie Now that's what I call handling things. 
pinkie Oh, nononono. Not good not good not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out come out wherever you are!
pinkie [toy squeaks]
pinkie Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
pinkie Pound Cake?  Here, Pound Cake!
pinkie [wind blowing]
pinkie Uh, Pound Cake? Uh...
pinkie  You can fly?!
pinkie Oh- get down here- this instant- young- colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
pinkie [plunger noises]
pinkie [magic noises]
pinkie No no no, Pumpkin.
pinkie No no.
pinkie No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no.
pinkie That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
pinkie 
pinkie Gotcha! I think? [lots of Whoa!s, ows, etc]
pinkie [banging on stairs]
pinkie 
pinkie Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
pinkie [banging on stairs]
pinkie [elastic stretching]
pinkie Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie  Y'know, you're right. That is funny.
pinkie Dear Princess Celestia, I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
pinkie [bell rings]
pinkie Shhh!
pinkie  Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
pinkie [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.
pinkie 
pinkie Speech! Speech!
pinkie Alright then, no speech!
pinkie And have fun. And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy and taffy gives lots of nervous energy! 
pinkie And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass.
pinkie Surprise!
pinkie Sorry! I was just practicing my “surprise!” for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champion of Equestria! Surprise!
pinkie Don't worry, Twilight. Got my lips all limbered up! [makes various noises with her mouth]
pinkie [door opens]
pinkie Surprise! Aw, shoot!
pinkie [panicked sounds under]
pinkie I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
pinkie Pickles!  Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!
pinkie [toilet flushes]
pinkie Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
pinkie I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back.
pinkie [door shuts]
pinkie Do you have any snacks?
pinkie That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!
pinkie What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!
pinkie Hey Applejack. Need some help?
pinkie I promise.
pinkie 
pinkie Have you ever had a cherry changa? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question.
pinkie Well no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherry changa is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a Chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or Chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel. Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, Chimicherrychanga!
pinkie [continues chant, muffled by Rainbow Dash]
pinkie Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... [continues under]
pinkie Do you Pinkie promise?
pinkie Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.
pinkie 
pinkie Good morning, Applejack. You ready for br- 
pinkie [sound of kettle boiling]
pinkie Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
pinkie Applejack! [slightly distorted] You Pinkie promised!
pinkie Applejack, come back here!
pinkie She's gonna get away!
pinkie Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!
pinkie 
pinkie Get them! Get them!
pinkie Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!
pinkie Wha?
pinkie Well, I... I...
pinkie Well I heard a sorry in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me.
pinkie What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry, or Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? Chimicherry, Cherrychanga? [continues under]
pinkie [continues repeating question to fadeout]
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too and now it's just a big old cider party! Woohoo! Oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any.
pinkie She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!
pinkie I'll never forget the cider I just drank! It was a moment in time that will never exist again...
pinkie Non-pa what?
pinkie Yes sir, ma'am, sir!
pinkie Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!
pinkie 
pinkie Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean-
pinkie Ooh yeah that's a good word. She's dazzling!
pinkie 
pinkie Ayiyiyiyi!
pinkie 
pinkie Ohh.
pinkie So much for dazzling.
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
pinkie [heart monitor beeping]
pinkie  Is her face gonna stay that way?
pinkie Ooh, just like a spider! [to the doctor] Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
pinkie And look! You have a roommate!
pinkie [wheels squeaking]
pinkie Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really...
pinkie Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh...
pinkie [door closes]
pinkie Hey, nopony invited me!
pinkie 
pinkie Oh, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
pinkie Fracas!
pinkie Let's do this. [wibbles tongue] Happy! Sad. Happy! Sad. Happy! Sad. Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut, open, shut. Yep, yep yep yep yep yep yep. Nope, nope nope nope nope nope nope. Oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooo, oooweooweooweoo! [blows raspberry, then pants]
pinkie [pinch noise]
pinkie Nailed it!
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
pinkie [rooster crows]
pinkie Morning, Daisy Jo! You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?
pinkie Well Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal.
pinkie Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year! I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again.
pinkie Absolutely!  Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!
pinkie Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.
pinkie Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!
pinkie And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you... in one hundred and thirty two days!
pinkie 'Cause everypony's my friend and I love to see my friends smile!
pinkie My name is Pinkie Pie (Hello!)
pinkie And I am here to say (How ya doin'?)
pinkie I'm gonna make you smile, and I will brighten up your day-aaay!
pinkie It doesn't matter now (What's up?)
pinkie If you are sad or blue (Howdy!)
pinkie 'Cause cheering up my friends is just what Pinkie's here to do
pinkie 'Cause I love to make you smile, smile, smile
pinkie Yes I do
pinkie It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
pinkie Yes it does
pinkie 'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile
pinkie From these happy friends of mine
pinkie I like to see you grin (Awesome!)
pinkie I would love to see you beam (Rock on!)
pinkie The corners of your mouth turned up
pinkie Is always Pinkie's dream (Hoof-bump!)
pinkie But if you're kind of worried
pinkie And your face has made a frown
pinkie I'll work real hard and do my best
pinkie To turn that sad frown upside down
pinkie 'Cause I love to make you grin, grin, grin
pinkie Yes I do
pinkie Bust it out from ear to ear, let it begin
pinkie Just give me a joyful grin, grin, grin
pinkie And you fill me with good cheer
pinkie It's true, some days are dark and lonely
pinkie And maybe you feel sad
pinkie But Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
pinkie There's one thing that makes me happy
pinkie And makes my whole life worthwhile
pinkie And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile
pinkie I really am so happy
pinkie Your smile fills me with glee
pinkie I give a smile, I get a smile
pinkie And that's so special to me
pinkie 'Cause I love to see you beam, beam, beam
pinkie Yes I do
pinkie Tell me, what more can I say to make you see
pinkie That I do
pinkie It makes me happy when you beam, beam, beam
pinkie Yes, it always makes my day!
pinkie Come on everypony smile, smile, smile
pinkie Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine
pinkie All I really need's a smile, smile, smile
pinkie From these happy friends of mine!
pinkie Come on everypony smile, smile, smile
pinkie Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine
pinkie All I really need's a smile, smile, smile
pinkie From these happy friends of mine!
pinkie Yes a perfect gift for me (>Choir Come on everypony smile, smile, smile)
pinkie Is a smile as wide as a mile (Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine)
pinkie To make me happy as can be (All I really need's a smile, smile, smile; from these happy friends of...)
pinkie Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile!
pinkie Come on and smile
pinkie Come on and smile!
pinkie I've never seen you before.
pinkie Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? “Property of C.D.D.” I'm guessing that last “D” is for Donkey.
pinkie Now, how 'bout that C. Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cleetus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher?-
pinkie And your middle name?
pinkie I'm sorry?
pinkie One more time...!
pinkie  So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
pinkie You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy.
pinkie A Cranky Doodle Donkey.
pinkie I never met you but you're my new friend and I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!
pinkie C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!
pinkie ...what just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'. Check!
pinkie Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?
pinkie Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do.
pinkie Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
pinkie But I don't need to go, when I can stay and make friends... with you.
pinkie Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do.
pinkie Ooh, what does this bauble do?
pinkie Ooooooh, what's this?
pinkie Oooh, look at these!
pinkie [windchimes chime]
pinkie Eeeheeeheee!
pinkie Okay, Cranky.   I promised not to touch your wagon so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks!
pinkie Maybe we can be wagon buddies? Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it...
pinkie That's the spirit!
pinkie Welcome welcome welcome
pinkie A fine welcome to you
pinkie Welcome welcome welcome
pinkie I say how do you do?
pinkie Welcome welcome welcome
pinkie I say hip hip hurray
pinkie Welcome welcome welcome
pinkie To Ponyville today
pinkie Wait for it!
pinkie (timer dings, oven door opens, confetti flies out, and party kazoos have blowned away Cranky Doodle Donkey's hat and hair)
pinkie Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again!   Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile.
pinkie Where is what?  Spider! Big hairy spider!
pinkie Oh. Was that your wig?
pinkie I can fix this, I can fix this! [through megaphone] Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?
pinkie [through megaphone] This donkey is really, really, bald!
pinkie [through megaphone] What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!
pinkie Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you...
pinkie Please! Oh, please please please... [fades out]
pinkie Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT.
pinkie Hi, Cranky, I have a gift for you!
pinkie It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the “dreamboat special”.
pinkie He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm.
pinkie Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
pinkie Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
pinkie Well, why didn't you say so?
pinkie This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
pinkie Really? What were you doin' there?
pinkie Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?
pinkie Like me?
pinkie [to herself] Yes. I'm in. [to Cranky] Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?
pinkie It's awfully pretty.
pinkie Huh?
pinkie I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about-
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Oh no!
pinkie There! Uh, all better?
pinkie I'm sorry, Cranky!
pinkie ...It is?
pinkie Never, or never-ever?
pinkie That's four 'ever's. That's like... forever!
pinkie I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
pinkie No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!
pinkie Cranky!
pinkie Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
pinkie So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
pinkie But do you accept my apology?
pinkie Oh Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!
pinkie But I'm really, really, really...
pinkie ...really, really-
pinkie [engines revving]
pinkie ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really really really... [continues saying “really”, speed increases until] ...sorry!
pinkie [sound of locks and chains]
pinkie [six knocks]
pinkie Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you!
pinkie Her? Her who? The special friend?
pinkie  Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
pinkie You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
pinkie Well when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday, nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
pinkie And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things.
pinkie And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
pinkie Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle...
pinkie So does this mean that you accept my apology?
pinkie [explodes like a firework] Woohoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together, and chat, and sing songs, and  party! Oh, I can throw you guys a big party! It'll be called a 'Welcome to Ponyville, I found my lost love, I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie Party'! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
pinkie Oh. Um, but we're still friends?
pinkie Great!
pinkie Dear Princess Celestia, there are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
pinkie He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart
pinkie She's his cranky doodle joy
pinkie I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah!
pinkie I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
pinkie Whoops, privacy. Sorry.
pinkie [Yankee Doodle Dandy plays over credits]
pinkie It's bigger than big, it's double big, you are a pony with a problem.
pinkie Right there! That's the problem.
pinkie What do you think you're doing?
pinkie Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous, one bit is the right price.
pinkie One bit.
pinkie One bit!
pinkie One bit!
pinkie Two bits!
pinkie Two bits!
pinkie I insist it's two bits or nothing!
pinkie Have it your way, one bit it is!
pinkie 
pinkie See? Asserting yourself can be fun!
pinkie Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
pinkie Who's next, please, and what can I get for you today?
pinkie Heyyy, look at you!
pinkie Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
pinkie Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some? 
pinkie Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
pinkie New Fluttershy... old Fluttershy...!?
pinkie Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershies to keep track of! Make it stop!
pinkie Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!
pinkie [starts crying] Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
pinkie 
pinkie It's Pinkie Pie, and Rarity!
pinkie We did?
pinkie Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
pinkie No, but he is.
pinkie Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
pinkie We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures, uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
pinkie But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.
pinkie A full day!
pinkie Full day!
pinkie Half day!
pinkie We need half a day and no more!
pinkie Okie dokie. See you tomorrow.
pinkie But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie [goat munching]
pinkie 
pinkie You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!
pinkie The one we missed!
pinkie Friends.
pinkie 
pinkie C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!
pinkie Run for your liiiiiiiife!
pinkie  Anypony else wanna panic with me? No? [resumes screaming]
pinkie Okay everypony, follow my lead. 
pinkie 
pinkie [stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?
pinkie I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
pinkie  Come... enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny...  Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?
pinkie  Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year...
pinkie That's it.
pinkie Yep. Cool birthday present.
pinkie Oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events.
pinkie 
pinkie Like that, see? Where did that even come from?
pinkie Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh...
pinkie [papers rustling]
pinkie Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
pinkie [to Twilight] Are... you okay?
pinkie Sure!
pinkie Nice!
pinkie Makes sense to me!
pinkie Three hours? But when did you sleep?
pinkie Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!
pinkie I have no idea!
pinkie Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
pinkie Aren't we wearing them for fun?
pinkie Oh... Are you sure?
pinkie Awesome! That sounds fun!
pinkie Aww.
pinkie 
pinkie [ripping sound]
pinkie I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
pinkie Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
pinkie Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
pinkie [orchestral twang]
pinkie [angelic choir]
pinkie Twilight, the guard!
pinkie Oh!
pinkie And that's bad, right?
pinkie Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?
pinkie Woohoo!
pinkie Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
pinkie Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now.
pinkie 
pinkie Me neither neither.
pinkie  Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!
pinkie  And 'super-duper scary'!
pinkie 
pinkie Oh, not even close!
pinkie Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. “Mayor, not naturally gray!” The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?
pinkie What?!  It's true! I do have a problem!
pinkie Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
pinkie Absolutely! It's my honor and I-
pinkie Alrighty then Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying.
pinkie Don't worry Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see!
pinkie Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance , better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right everypony, we're in the home stretch here. See Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?
pinkie [<a href="/wiki/Theme_song" title="Theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie  Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
pinkie Well the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the "MMMM".
pinkie Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
pinkie Hello. What's your name?
pinkie The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
pinkie Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect "MMMM."
pinkie Mmm hmmm. I know for super sure that "MMMM" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too.
pinkie So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
pinkie But they are! I just know it.
pinkie I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
pinkie Huh? Stop you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh? Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what.
pinkie [blinds snap shut]
pinkie Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!
pinkie 
pinkie Stop thief!
pinkie 
pinkie Oh, are you okay thief?  Huh... overreacting my hoof. I knew I was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what I'm gonna do. 
pinkie [rooster crow]
pinkie  Huh? What?  The cake! Oh MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous.
pinkie I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
pinkie Look at what? Huh? 
pinkie 
pinkie It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been  mutilated.
pinkie 
pinkie Now we just need to find out who done it.
pinkie Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
pinkie Exactly.
pinkie 
pinkie And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
pinkie Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
pinkie Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is...
pinkie No! 'Cause I know who did it.
pinkie 
pinkie How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your éclairs lacked flair, Gustave!
pinkie [silent film music]
pinkie Thus, destroying the cake, and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.
pinkie What do you mean, lowly assistant?
pinkie Huh... guess that isn't a totally silly question.
pinkie Hm... you're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "MMMM" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!
pinkie [spy music]
pinkie Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie [spraying noise]
pinkie [laser noise]
pinkie Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
pinkie Huh... you may be right, lowly assistant.
pinkie Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
pinkie Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".
pinkie Mulia Mild!
pinkie [ninja sounds]
pinkie 
pinkie [cutting sounds]
pinkie Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself Mulia.
pinkie  I guess you're right...
pinkie But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "MMMM". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. Hoh, why this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?

pinkie 
pinkie  Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
pinkie This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
pinkie Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?
pinkie I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
pinkie And then, I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there he was gone.
pinkie Already?
pinkie I heard somepony else in the dessert car, and chased them up to the engine. But, when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
pinkie Well... I went back to the dessert car.
pinkie The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
pinkie I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud, and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
pinkie That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
pinkie Exactly.
pinkie A-ha! A blue feather. I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand.
pinkie No, 'cause he's been dying them!
pinkie So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
pinkie So it was you, that pink hair came from your rainbow colored mane!
pinkie So you're wearing a wig?
pinkie [stretching noises]
pinkie You're goin' down, Fluttershy.
pinkie That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
pinkie You're right Twilight. You know what we have to do?
pinkie Look for clues! Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
pinkie I most certainly did. It was, none other than, the bakers!
pinkie 
pinkie First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache, and Joe has éclair in his hair, and Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
pinkie I think we can fix that. Come on!
pinkie Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts.
pinkie How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?
pinkie I don't mind if I do.
pinkie [munching sounds]
pinkie Mmmmm.
pinkie 
pinkie 
pinkie Hip, hip, hooray!
pinkie   Best wedding ever!
pinkie We're here, we're here!
pinkie Aaaaaaaaa- [sneezes like a trumpet]
pinkie Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...
pinkie [polka from Swarm of the Century plays]
pinkie I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
pinkie  Thank you!
pinkie [kissing noises and laughing]
pinkie Rarity!
pinkie  Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better.
pinkie [fly flying sounds]
pinkie Let's get this party started!
pinkie Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
pinkie Time to gather some intel!
pinkie Because it isn't!
pinkie Aaaah!
pinkie A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y! 
pinkie Oh, we have to get this right
pinkie Yes we have to make them see
pinkie We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
pinkie There was a crystal flugelhorn
pinkie That everypony liked to play
pinkie Oh, we have to get this right
pinkie Yes we have to make them see
pinkie We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
pinkie It's gonna be fun!
