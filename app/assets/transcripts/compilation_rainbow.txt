rainbow [sheepish laughter] Uh, 'scuse me? [more sheepish laughter]
rainbow  Lemme help you.
rainbow [rushing water]
rainbow [more sheepish laughter] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no, don't thank me, you're quite welcome. [bursts out laughing]
rainbow The one and only. Why, you heard of me?
rainbow Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
rainbow The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
rainbow Yep!
rainbow That's them!
rainbow Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
rainbow [sounds of exertion] Loop the loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing]  You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.
rainbow What did you do with our Princess?!
rainbow Come back here!  Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
rainbow And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!
rainbow Nopony knows. You know why?
rainbow 'cause every pony who's ever come in, has never come OUT.
rainbow 
rainbow Fluttershy! Quick!
rainbow And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
rainbow I'm on it.
rainbow Little?
rainbow Right here... guh...
rainbow Then what is?
rainbow Oh, give me a break.
rainbow So would the mustache.
rainbow What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
rainbow Duh.
rainbow Who's there?
rainbow I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
rainbow Who?
rainbow Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever.
rainbow Yep.
rainbow Yes.
rainbow Yes,  it's all true.
rainbow WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
rainbow You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
rainbow Where's the sixth?
rainbow Ugh, my head.
rainbow Aw yeah.
rainbow Whoa!  Ugh. Are we talking about The Grand Galloping Gala?
rainbow No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
rainbow YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at The Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on The Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!
rainbow [audience gasps]
rainbow I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
rainbow [audience cheers]
rainbow Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, The Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!
rainbow [ponies go wild]
rainbow The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member. Don't you see, Twilight? This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. You gotta take me! 
rainbow So? That doesn't mean you own it.
rainbow 
rainbow A chance to audition for The Wonderbolts?
rainbow Living the dream.
rainbow Okay.
rainbow 
rainbow Wait just a minute.
rainbow No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
rainbow Your ticket?
rainbow Hi there best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?
rainbow Whaddya you mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
rainbow Me? No no no, of course not.
rainbow Seriously, I'd do it for any pony. Heh heh, eh.
rainbow Ugh, fine. 
rainbow Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket-- you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for The Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either.
rainbow What a great way to apologize.
rainbow STAMPEDE!
rainbow [cows mooing]
rainbow [ponies panicking]
rainbow Look there!
rainbow Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
rainbow But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
rainbow Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
rainbow Tired?
rainbow There you are.
rainbow See this contraption?
rainbow Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
rainbow Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
rainbow Ready? One... two... THREE!
rainbow Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
rainbow Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
rainbow Ugh!
rainbow Wait, Applejaaaaack!
rainbow 
rainbow I think somepony else needs your help.
rainbow Yep.
rainbow STAMPEDE!
rainbow [ponies scream]
rainbow Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
rainbow  Pinkie Pie? Not again.
rainbow Not now, Pinkie Pie.
rainbow I'm in the middle of something.
rainbow I said not now--
rainbow 
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow 
rainbow Phew. That was close.
rainbow Aah!
rainbow 
rainbow Aah!
rainbow Waaa--oh, forget it.
rainbow  Okay.
rainbow Pinkie Pie!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow I can think of one thing.
rainbow I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
rainbow You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.
rainbow You wanna hang out?
rainbow A simple nod would do.
rainbow Is she even home?
rainbow There she is.
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow [water splash]
rainbow  Fluttershy.
rainbow Yeah, you're right.  Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?
rainbow Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?
rainbow  Good one, Pinkie Pie.
rainbow 
rainbow Ridiculous.
rainbow Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
rainbow Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
rainbow She's half-eagle, half-lion.
rainbow Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?
rainbow Sooo...
rainbow Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.
rainbow 
rainbow Yeah, only faster. So now what?
rainbow Huh?
rainbow Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
rainbow A race? You are so on.
rainbow I win.
rainbow No way.
rainbow Oh, ome on, I was way ahead of you.
rainbow Oh Geez, dream on.
rainbow There is no way you beat me.
rainbow Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.
rainbow New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.
rainbow Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
rainbow Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
rainbow Later.
rainbow Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream.
rainbow Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
rainbow G, the punch.
rainbow Ha. Priceless. Priceless. 
rainbow Hey G, look, presents.
rainbow 
rainbow Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
rainbow Come on then, let's have some cake.
rainbow You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
rainbow So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
rainbow They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
rainbow And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
rainbow Not cool.
rainbow I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
rainbow I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
rainbow Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.  Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!
rainbow So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
rainbow There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
rainbow That's my job!
rainbow [electric guitar music]
rainbow They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!
rainbow Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a!  I think I'm  gonna be sick.
rainbow Ow!
rainbow 
rainbow Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
rainbow It's fine.
rainbow Unbelievable!
rainbow Hate you?
rainbow Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.
rainbow And after whuppin' that ursa's hind quarters, we're even prouder.
rainbow Uh-huh.
rainbow Why that little...
rainbow Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven...
rainbow Three hundred fifty four...
rainbow Three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
rainbow Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
rainbow Huh?
rainbow I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that!
rainbow 
rainbow Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?
rainbow Raaah!
rainbow You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets.
rainbow Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.
rainbow Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down.
rainbow Whoa. What was that?
rainbow Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!
rainbow Oh, all right.
rainbow Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
rainbow Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?
rainbow Augh.
rainbow  Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever.
rainbow Told you it was going to take them forever.
rainbow Ugh.
rainbow Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
rainbow Not your fault.
rainbow  Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
rainbow Mm-hmm.
rainbow Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too.
rainbow Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
rainbow Augh.
rainbow I'm not!
rainbow So much for  persuading him.
rainbow All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does.
rainbow It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
rainbow Get! Out! 
rainbow Heh. Sorry.
rainbow Who-o-o-o-o-a!
rainbow 
rainbow Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
rainbow 
rainbow Dragon!
rainbow [goat bleat]
rainbow 
rainbow  Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!
rainbow Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.
rainbow Sinister.
rainbow And the clouds move...
rainbow All on their own!
rainbow Here we go. ...
rainbow Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
rainbow W..what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
rainbow And Zecora's still out there.
rainbow Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
rainbow Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.
rainbow Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
rainbow  Ow!  Oh! She's  trying to say-ow!- Zecora -oh!- she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!
rainbow  I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
rainbow I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?
rainbow How about you, Applejack? Applejack?
rainbow Rarity's hair!
rainbow I bet they went after Zecora.
rainbow Hey, a little help here?
rainbow  OW!
rainbow Hey, wait for me! [screaming and owing]
rainbow Ex-CUSE me?
rainbow What the...
rainbow Aaah!
rainbow 
rainbow Ahh!
rainbow You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
rainbow Ok, fine. But what about the cauldron?
rainbow Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy. This is waaay too boring for me.
rainbow Ugh, sooo boooring.
rainbow What's that sound, Twilight?
rainbow Wow, what are they?
rainbow Uh, I'll take one.
rainbow [baby noises]
rainbow Huh? Huh?!    Get off me!   Waaa!
rainbow Ditto!
rainbow Guh.
rainbow Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
rainbow Aye aye.
rainbow Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
rainbow Alright. 
rainbow We call in the weather patrol. 
rainbow Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
rainbow Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Woah! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
rainbow Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
rainbow YEEEAAAA!
rainbow They're not that adorable.
rainbow Some sort of infestation.
rainbow Three months of winter coolness
rainbow And awesome holidays
rainbow –is here!
rainbow Bringing home the southern birds
rainbow A Pegasus' job begins
rainbow And clearing all the gloomy skies
rainbow To let the sunshine in
rainbow We move the clouds
rainbow And we melt the white snow
rainbow When the sun comes up
rainbow Its warmth and beauty will glow!
rainbow Alright team, you're clear for takeoff.
rainbow Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?
rainbow Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
rainbow Um...
rainbow Sorry Twilight.
rainbow Got it.
rainbow Got it.
rainbow Okay.
rainbow Ugh! Make up your minds!
rainbow Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
rainbow Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
rainbow [Ponies grumble and complain]
rainbow Wow, looks like some pony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?
rainbow Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that! 
rainbow Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
rainbow Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.
rainbow That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?
rainbow I said: Are! You! Ready!
rainbow Juggling, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow Hang-gliding, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow Karate, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow Kite-flying, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow Ultrapony Roller Derby, go! [whistle blows]
rainbow [>Roller ponies
rainbow ]
rainbow Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
rainbow Tried that one... tried that one...
rainbow Eating cupcakes?
rainbow  Woo-hoo!
rainbow Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?
rainbow Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
rainbow 
rainbow Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.
rainbow I lost.
rainbow I hate losing.
rainbow All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
rainbow ...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
rainbow I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
rainbow 
rainbow Iron Pony competition.
rainbow The most athletic pony ever! 
rainbow  I don' know. Why is she here?
rainbow Right, heh. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books. 
rainbow Thanks, but I  couldn't have been as fast as you.
rainbow Oh, I can't believe I won.
rainbow Ugh.
rainbow Ready for another pony ride?
rainbow  Does this count?
rainbow Yuh
rainbow [ponies cheer]
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow Yeah.
rainbow [ponies gasp]
rainbow Fluttershy: 
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow Yes!
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow 
rainbow [bell rings]
rainbow [hens clucking]
rainbow [chicks chirping]
rainbow Huh?
rainbow I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
rainbow Woo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case.  I am the Iron Pony!
rainbow What?
rainbow Sounds like sour apples to me.
rainbow Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
rainbow I still would have won even without my wings.
rainbow Gladly. How?
rainbow Heh! Easy shmeasy.
rainbow No wings? No problem.
rainbow 
rainbow [blows raspberry]
rainbow Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.
rainbow So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?
rainbow Yeah, yeah...
rainbow I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
rainbow Very funny.
rainbow  Good one, Twilight.
rainbow What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.
rainbow Egghead.
rainbow And you know this from...
rainbow What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?  Get it? Eye muscles.
rainbow Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.
rainbow Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.
rainbow You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
rainbow Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!
rainbow Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.
rainbow Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.
rainbow Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.
rainbow Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.
rainbow Look, ma, no wings.
rainbow 
rainbow [blows raspberry]
rainbow Nice one, Rainbow.
rainbow  Aaa!
rainbow 
rainbow  I'm sure I'll win now.
rainbow Oh horse apples... See ya!
rainbow What the hay?! You said no flying!
rainbow  Aaa!
rainbow Whoa!
rainbow You know, I think Twilight's right.
rainbow Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!
rainbow No, you cut it out!
rainbow And now I'm gonna finish it.
rainbow Oh yes, I will.  That's it! All bets are off!
rainbow I won!
rainbow I won!
rainbow Tied?!
rainbow Then who won?
rainbow YOU?
rainbow You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
rainbow I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
rainbow We weren't very good sports.
rainbow Princess Celestia?!
rainbow I'd love to stretch my legs.
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Look out below!
rainbow Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
rainbow Outfit for the what now?
rainbow Oh, I love fun things!
rainbow Yeah, they're...
rainbow Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
rainbow What?
rainbow No, I just want my dress to be cool.
rainbow The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
rainbow The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler.
rainbow All we really like is what we know
rainbow It's cool!
rainbow That's so cool!
rainbow You think we overdid it?
rainbow She kind of is.
rainbow That's your answer for everything!
rainbow Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
rainbow You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
rainbow Now, what have we learned?
rainbow Good.
rainbow Yes, and most importantly?
rainbow Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
rainbow ... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
rainbow Louder!
rainbow Louder!
rainbow Ugh...
rainbow [deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine.
rainbow Phase two.
rainbow Here we go. Phase three. The sonic rainboom. C'mon!  Uh-oh. 
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. THAT was a truly feeble performance.
rainbow Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!
rainbow  I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
rainbow Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
rainbow It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
rainbow Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
rainbow The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my life-long heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
rainbow I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. YOU, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
rainbow You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.
rainbow I didn't get kicked out.
rainbow  Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
rainbow Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Every pony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
rainbow Rare?! The sonic rainboom is WAY more than rare!
rainbow Rarity! Are you... flying?!
rainbow We?.. I... I can't believe it!
rainbow This is so cool! You guys made it!
rainbow WAIT!.. How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
rainbow To be honest, I was starting to get just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a LOT better now that you guys are here.
rainbow Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
rainbow Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
rainbow Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
rainbow Great idea! C'mon girls. To the weather factory!
rainbow This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
rainbow We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
rainbow And here's where they make the rainbows!
rainbow Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
rainbow Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
rainbow Oohh...
rainbow Are you kidding? I can't DO the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!
rainbow [group of workers awing at Rarity]
rainbow  Of course! Why wouldn't I be ok? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
rainbow WHAT?!
rainbow [workers continue awing at Rarity]
rainbow What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now...
rainbow [crowd cheering]
rainbow EYAH!
rainbow Umm...
rainbow She's talking to you!
rainbow Uhh... What am I gonna do?
rainbow [Scared babble]
rainbow  C'mon Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one.
rainbow [crowd cheering]
rainbow Oof. WAAAH!
rainbow Time for phase two.
rainbow Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic  rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now!
rainbow [crowd gasps]
rainbow 
rainbow Hold on Rarity! I'm coming!
rainbow 
rainbow Whoa.
rainbow [crowd cheering]
rainbow I did it. I did it!
rainbow Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day EVER!
rainbow Aw, it's ok. Everything turned out alright, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.
rainbow  OhmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohMYGOSH!
rainbow OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
rainbow Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
rainbow This really is the best day EVER!
rainbow Heh, thanks guys.
rainbow Aww, that's ok. Don't worry about it.
rainbow Sorry boys... But I've got plans!
rainbow [end credits]
rainbow Yeah. Cause all you said earlier was...
rainbow We'll see about that.
rainbow Get 'em!
rainbow Come on!
rainbow Twilight!
rainbow That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
rainbow She must be in there. Let's go!
rainbow Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
rainbow Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
rainbow Ghk...
rainbow Awwww!
rainbow  Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?
rainbow  If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?
rainbow  When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?
rainbow [whispering and sarcasm] ... No, Fluttershy.
rainbow  I do not think she's a tree! I was just –
rainbow  No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly –
rainbow Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act.
rainbow Hey there!
rainbow Where ya headed in such a hurry?
rainbow Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky... No offense.
rainbow I just wanna know – Hey!
rainbow I'm talking to you – Whoa...
rainbow Arrgggg... I got you now, you – 
rainbow Ugggh..
rainbow Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...
rainbow Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
rainbow Yah! … Pinkie Pie!
rainbow Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
rainbow You're gonna blow my cover.
rainbow I'm trying to save Spike!
rainbow And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... Caught.
rainbow Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!
rainbow  Ugh...
rainbow Huh.. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still –
rainbow You!
rainbow That's it! We are outta here!
rainbow Yeah, right.
rainbow Huh?
rainbow Hmph...
rainbow Huh-ah.. I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosians to talk to!
rainbow We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
rainbow We brought our new pal, Little Strongheart here, to explain to the Appleloosians why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
rainbow The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
rainbow Plant the trees somewhere else!
rainbow The BUFFALO had it FIRST!
rainbow Come ON Applejack!
rainbow [At the same time] >Applejack
rainbow You're bein' unreasonable! >Rainbow Dash
rainbow I put my hoof down!
rainbow I know you don't want to do this.
rainbow I don't know... But it's never too late to think of something.
rainbow Come on, THINK. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!
rainbow  He's not gonna do it!
rainbow [Pinkie Pie]
rainbow –whaddaya say?
rainbow You got to share
rainbow You got to care
rainbow It's the right thing to do
rainbow So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?  Is the pay good?  Hellooo! Anybody home?
rainbow Ooh, you're good.  Too good. I'm bored.
rainbow What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? 1 2 3 GO!
rainbow [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!
rainbow [royal guards laugh]
rainbow Yeah!
rainbow [everypony laughs]
rainbow <a href="/wiki/Credits" title="Credits">credits</a>
rainbow I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story?
rainbow It all happened during the race at Flight Camp, where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor. I've never flown like THAT before. That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt. The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it a lot.
rainbow Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning! Most people thought that the Sonic Rainboom was just an old mare's tail. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!
rainbow And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
rainbow Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
rainbow Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?
rainbow He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
rainbow Nice one! Now, let me show you how it’s really done.
rainbow Hey, Pinkie Pie!
rainbow Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!
rainbow  What kind of surprises?
rainbow See ya later, birthday alligator!
rainbow This afternoon?
rainbow Oh, man! We’d love to, but… we’re… house-sitting this afternoon.
rainbow Uh, look at the time! We’d really better get going.
rainbow Harry.
rainbow Yeah, I don’t think you know him.
rainbow Yup! He’s a bear all right, and he’ll be pretty upset if we don’t get over to his house soon.
rainbow But he’s fixed up the place so much it feels like a house.
rainbow A-at the beach!
rainbow Yup! He loves to...
rainbow [over Fluttershy] Play beach volleyball! ...Collect sea shells! ...Play sea shells!
rainbow Gotta go!
rainbow Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!
rainbow Phew…
rainbow Ah!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Applejack! We have a problem!
rainbow  You heard her! Construction!
rainbow [ponies mimicking noises of various construction tools]
rainbow Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn’t slow down and say, “Hello.” You know how it goes.
rainbow Yeah… so, why don’t you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
rainbow Uh… Pinkie Pie?
rainbow Aaallrighty. What do you say we get out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack’s…
rainbow You should really just come with me.
rainbow Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh… That’s it. Party’s over. Come on, Pinkie Pie!
rainbow Pinkie Pie, let’s go!
rainbow You…  have to… come with… me!
rainbow Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We’ll do this the hard way!
rainbow  We're... here...
rainbow Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
rainbow Uh-huh! It sure would.
rainbow I’m just glad I haven’t been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
rainbow You don’t wanna know.
rainbow For Gummy, yeah!
rainbow For what?
rainbow Sure thing, Spike.
rainbow Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
rainbow Been dreaming, I've been waiting
rainbow To fly with those brave ponies
rainbow The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks
rainbow Spinning 'round and having kicks
rainbow Perform for crowds of thousands
rainbow They'll shower us with diamonds
rainbow The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala!
rainbow As a Wonderbolt is
rainbow To prove!
rainbow Hey, no prob.
rainbow Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
rainbow Sure. Why not? I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts! [squee, giggle]
rainbow Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to Soarin'] You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome!
rainbow This isn't hanging out.
rainbow If it's the last thing I do...
rainbow Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.
rainbow This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
rainbow Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
rainbow Come back here you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this?... Cotton candy? Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just– you did. Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!
rainbow There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
rainbow All right, Princess!
rainbow Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
rainbow That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
rainbow Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
rainbow The first rule?
rainbow Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
rainbow Moving out!
rainbow I've got you now, element.
rainbow Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
rainbow I've got a message for you, too!
rainbow Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
rainbow Hey guys!
rainbow That's nice.
rainbow Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
rainbow Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine.
rainbow Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone!
rainbow Wh-what happened?  How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
rainbow [assorted grunting and hi-yah noises]
rainbow Uh, what are you talking about?
rainbow I don't have any issues with Applejack.
rainbow ...because she asked me to. Right Applejack?
rainbow You got it, boss.
rainbow 
rainbow [various shock statements]
rainbow Yes?
rainbow Yes?
rainbow Yes?
rainbow [sighs of relief]
rainbow 
rainbow Canterlot?
rainbow Wait!
rainbow ...but we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
rainbow Mmhmm.
rainbow [All right, etc]
rainbow 
rainbow Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
rainbow 
rainbow [laughing maniacally]
rainbow Lighten up, old-timer. It's the best night of the year for pranks!
rainbow It's all in good fun. OH OH, there's another group over there!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Haha! Woohoo! Yeah!  Woah!
rainbow Who? Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious. C'mon, try and keep up! 
rainbow Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
rainbow  Whaa!
rainbow Phew.
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow What are you all doing out here?
rainbow Uh, you do?
rainbow Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?
rainbow Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!
rainbow I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules
rainbow It's of utmost importance
rainbow The pet that I get
rainbow Is something that's awesome and cool
rainbow I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
rainbow Cutesy, wootsie? Have you even met me?
rainbow Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
rainbow Pass.
rainbow Otters and seals do not fly.
rainbow That's it. I'm outta here.
rainbow Bigger. And cooler.
rainbow It's just a squirrel.
rainbow ...Yeah. So, like I was saying...
rainbow Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it
rainbow I need a pet to keep up with me
rainbow Something awesome, something flying
rainbow With coolness that defies gravity!
rainbow Ya think?
rainbow Better, but cooler.
rainbow Now you're talking. But instead of just one standout, now that's too many.
rainbow So many choices, and such riches aplenty
rainbow The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too
rainbow Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?
rainbow What to do, what to do? 
rainbow A prize! That's it! There's really just one way
rainbow To find out which animal's best
rainbow Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts
rainbow That will put each pet to the test
rainbow Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
rainbow Just like me
rainbow Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best
rainbow So a contest we will see
rainbow Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet
rainbow In the world for me
rainbow Begin
rainbow And may the best pet win!
rainbow [blows whistle]
rainbow [whistle blow] Shh! [to assembled animals] So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?
rainbow Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?
rainbow No.
rainbow Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!
rainbow But--
rainbow Grrgh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed, agility, guts, style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness.
rainbow You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
rainbow Speed! On your marks...
rainbow Get set... [blows whistle] Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
rainbow Yeah! That's speed!
rainbow [to the tortoise] That's just sad.
rainbow Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
rainbow Yeah baby, now that's what I call agility! Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
rainbow Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
rainbow Now that takes guts!
rainbow Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
rainbow Coolness!
rainbow [owl hoots]
rainbow Sorta cool.
rainbow [duck quacks]
rainbow Not cool.
rainbow [bat cries]
rainbow Pretty cool.
rainbow [toucan cries]
rainbow Could be cooler.
rainbow [wasp buzzing]
rainbow Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you!
rainbow [tortoise coughs]
rainbow Eugh.
rainbow [eagle cries]
rainbow Now that's a cool sound!
rainbow [to bat] Sorta awesome. [to toucan] Not awesome. [to flamingo] Could be more awesome. [to owl] Hohoho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?
rainbow [bat plays theme song, squeals and glasses shatter]
rainbow Whoa! That was truly awesome! But... I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.  Listen, turtle...
rainbow Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.
rainbow [turtle croaks]
rainbow You didn't.
rainbow I mean... A for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final, tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect ...a race against me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!
rainbow [eagle cries]
rainbow Gesundheit.
rainbow ["Ride of the Valkyries" plays]
rainbow Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so, obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor, and glory, of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo!
rainbow Woohoo! Haha! Try to keep up!
rainbow Can't catch me, ha ha!
rainbow 
rainbow C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?
rainbow Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa.
rainbow Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right guys?
rainbow AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa!
rainbow C'mon... no! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!
rainbow Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha- You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!
rainbow Just my pride.
rainbow Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
rainbow Oh... right... yeah. That.
rainbow Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does looks cool... he's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet. 
rainbow But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
rainbow And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me, was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
rainbow [falcon cry]
rainbow Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia, I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.
rainbow Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.
rainbow Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
rainbow Hmm...
rainbow Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
rainbow 
rainbow [ponies chattering]
rainbow What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
rainbow [ponies agreeing]
rainbow 
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow  What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
rainbow Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks everypony. It was really no big deal.
rainbow  Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
rainbow [crowd gasps]
rainbow She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow [cameras clicking]
rainbow Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
rainbow [old ponies screaming]
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow I can't hear you!
rainbow And then, I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
rainbow Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
rainbow Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
rainbow ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?
rainbow This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.
rainbow  There you go.
rainbow Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
rainbow  Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
rainbow Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
rainbow [ponies screaming]
rainbow [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow-
rainbow Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
rainbow [jackhammer and drills]
rainbow Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor- whoa!
rainbow [building creaking]
rainbow Never fear-uh-I'm coming- Hold on- whoa!
rainbow Here ya go, safe and sound.
rainbow 
rainbow Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare-Do-Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
rainbow  Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.
rainbow [water rushing]
rainbow  If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.
rainbow [stone cracking]
rainbow My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself-   Help!  Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank- You gotta be kidding me...
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow Oh, for the love of pete.
rainbow 
rainbow I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
rainbow I didn't say that.
rainbow Who, me?
rainbow Don't write that, Spike!
rainbow [others laughing]
rainbow Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good- no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!
rainbow Huh, no sign of trouble here, darnit.
rainbow Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
rainbow Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?  Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here.
rainbow You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!
rainbow Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
rainbow  Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
rainbow  Somepony's in trouble!
rainbow You'd better let me open this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
rainbow [clicks neck] 
rainbow Ta-da!
rainbow How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
rainbow Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?
rainbow Oh look!
rainbow [lawnmower rattling]
rainbow Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
rainbow From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
rainbow Aww, who am I kidding?
rainbow [thundercloud rumbles throughout]
rainbow All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this, and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.
rainbow I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.
rainbow Wait a minute. Why are you here?
rainbow No! No way! Can't you see I- I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
rainbow Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.  Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e-  Hey squirt! Wait up!
rainbow The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
rainbow [ponies gasp]
rainbow So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
rainbow What the hay?
rainbow Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved!  P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?
rainbow I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
rainbow Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
rainbow Okay, a lot.
rainbow Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
rainbow That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
rainbow Okay, let's hear it.
rainbow Look out! It's a real ghost!
rainbow How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
rainbow Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
rainbow Duh, the one in your mouth!
rainbow Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!
rainbow Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
rainbow Huh?  Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
rainbow Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
rainbow That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
rainbow Put her down, right now!
rainbow I mean it, dragon boy!
rainbow Drop her, scaly!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Look! The Wonderbolts!
rainbow On it!
rainbow [wind rushing]
rainbow All in a day's work.
rainbow I can hardly wait!
rainbow Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.
rainbow I spy a snowpony!
rainbow Aaah, Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!
rainbow Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
rainbow 
rainbow All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!?
rainbow For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!
rainbow What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.
rainbow You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!
rainbow Well, I'm leaving first!
rainbow 
rainbow Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?
rainbow Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!
rainbow We must find a new land!
rainbow C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!
rainbow [lightning cracks]
rainbow Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!
rainbow You never know where enemies might be lurking.
rainbow A-ha! What's that?! [fighting noises]
rainbow Okay. This is getting old.
rainbow This is the new land we've been searching for!
rainbow I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!
rainbow We found our new home!
rainbow I planted my flag first!
rainbow Did too!
rainbow The name is Pegasopolis!
rainbow Pegasopolis!
rainbow I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win!
rainbow [wind blows]
rainbow I'll have you court-martialled for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow Oh no. Not again.
rainbow [wind blowing]
rainbow It's Commander Hurricane.
rainbow You mean like this, your highness?
rainbow Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!
rainbow What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!
rainbow  I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
rainbow Hey! You invaded our territory!
rainbow That's the last straw!
rainbow [arguing over rock]
rainbow Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!
rainbow You've been fighting too, your highness.
rainbow That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls!
rainbow Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
rainbow Y'know what? I got it.
rainbow Aw yeah, heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake gets there his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
rainbow I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash!
rainbow Huh? Now, <span title="&quot;be careful&quot; in the updated iTunes rerelease and just &quot;careful&quot; on subsequent television airings" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">careful, Derpy</span>! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
rainbow 
rainbow Yeah. It's a mystery.
rainbow 
rainbow No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
rainbow [wood splintering]
rainbow Seeya in a week!
rainbow Well, that is the point.
rainbow What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
rainbow So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!
rainbow I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
rainbow Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
rainbow “Change of scenery”? What's that supposed to mean?
rainbow Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!
rainbow Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
rainbow Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
rainbow [gears turning]
rainbow Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
rainbow Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
rainbow Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
rainbow That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
rainbow It's time to call in the big guns.
rainbow [five thumps]
rainbow The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans.
rainbow Tomorrow, huh? I don't know...
rainbow Yeah, maybe.
rainbow Pull over!
rainbow Come on, Fluttershy!
rainbow No time! They knew what they were getting into!
rainbow Not so fast!
rainbow 
rainbow But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
rainbow And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
rainbow Nn-nn.
rainbow Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
rainbow C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!
rainbow The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
rainbow Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line and then they always run out of cider!
rainbow Well not this year! This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want, and laugh when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her- 
rainbow Who are all these ponies?!
rainbow 
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow 
rainbow Surprise surprise. You ran out again!
rainbow Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
rainbow 
rainbow 
rainbow [motorized noises]
rainbow I doubt that.
rainbow Oh for Pete's sake!
rainbow Is this some kind of cruel joke?
rainbow Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
rainbow In my sleep!
rainbow We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
rainbow Applejack, help me!
rainbow All right then, double time!
rainbow I ought to press you into jerk cider!
rainbow Awwww.
rainbow Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!
rainbow You guys have gotta get me out of here, I'm gonna climb the walls!
rainbow Few days? Might as well be a few months, or few years!
rainbow What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
rainbow No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
rainbow ...to get to the other side! Get it? Nevermind...
rainbow [clock ticking]
rainbow [growls in frustration] 
rainbow [Dash's head banging on bed]
rainbow   As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years! Huh. I'm right there with you, sister.
rainbow The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step.
rainbow [various big cats growling and roaring]
rainbow [kitten mewing]
rainbow [steadily getting more excited] Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!
rainbow I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I- I love reading! I'm an egghead.
rainbow The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple.
rainbow [beetles scuttling]
rainbow 
rainbow [various noises: metal hitting stone, fire whooshing, alligators snapping, shing, etc]
rainbow 
rainbow Uh, hey, guys...
rainbow [short nervous laugh] No no, you first.
rainbow Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again!
rainbow Whoaa, you found my seagull.
rainbow [seagull crying]
rainbow You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud. You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose. [makes horse noise]
rainbow You win some, you lose some.
rainbow  Thanks for coming!
rainbow Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading.  It's nap time for me! [mocks snoring]
rainbow 
rainbow Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber.
rainbow At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!
rainbow [stone clinking]
rainbow [arrows firing]
rainbow Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but-
rainbow Oh, just in time. I am soo hungry.
rainbow [makes exaggerated eating noises]
rainbow  ”You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.”
rainbow Whoa! Who is this dude?
rainbow H- oh, good evening-
rainbow -morning. Doc.
rainbow Of course not. 
rainbow What? Later today? [biting hoof]
rainbow Right now?! 'Right now' right now?
rainbow But I don't feel better!
rainbow How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!
rainbow Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all... Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
rainbow Owww... [grunts in pain unrealistically] Oh, the pain... the pain!
rainbow Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there.
rainbow Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
rainbow B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!
rainbow What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing...
rainbow [owl hoots]
rainbow 
rainbow [heart monitor beeping]
rainbow I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!
rainbow 
rainbow  I'm an egghead.
rainbow See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of-
rainbow You got me.
rainbow Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it.
rainbow Oh, thanks Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
rainbow Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
rainbow [to Spike] Didja get all that?
rainbow Great! You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book! 
rainbow And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured...
rainbow ...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do! [sighs in admiration] Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet... Awesome!
rainbow 
rainbow [indistinct chatter]
rainbow [school bell ringing]
rainbow Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
rainbow You got it!
rainbow And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
rainbow Hey, Twilight, another pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and-  What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?
rainbow  Oh, this is too rich.  Hey Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!
rainbow 
rainbow Oh no!
rainbow Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a-
rainbow Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
rainbow Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!
rainbow Yeaagh! Ugh!
rainbow Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.
rainbow [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
rainbow Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?
rainbow Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?
rainbow [dragon roaring]
rainbow  Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind.
rainbow  Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!
rainbow 
rainbow One tough stain against one lame dragon. 
rainbow Hey guys!
rainbow Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
rainbow What?!?
rainbow Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary...
rainbow All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
rainbow Aaagh!
rainbow Don't tell me you think he should go?
rainbow I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.
rainbow [under her breath] Rrgh.
rainbow Yeah, we hope your trip-
rainbow - your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?" questions.
rainbow Go get 'em, big guy!
rainbow I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
rainbow We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!
rainbow [strained noise]
rainbow Not so fast!
rainbow Forever?!
rainbow I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
rainbow Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!
rainbow I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!
rainbow Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
rainbow 
rainbow Calling all pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
rainbow Library, tonight. Be cool, or be mule. No offense.
rainbow Alright, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go.

rainbow [old film projector running up]
rainbow [old music begins playing]
rainbow So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.
rainbow Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
rainbow ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.
rainbow That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?
rainbow Are we gonna be strong?
rainbow Are we gonna be fast?
rainbow Record-smashing fast?
rainbow Who's with me?
rainbow Fluttershy!
rainbow Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
rainbow Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy.
rainbow  Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open-
rainbow Fluttershy, what happened to you?
rainbow Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
rainbow Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
rainbow [blows whistle]
rainbow Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?
rainbow What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
rainbow It wasn't that bad.
rainbow Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for- I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get.
rainbow  Thanks anyway.
rainbow You will?
rainbow You're game?
rainbow Alright!
rainbow Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?
rainbow Not bad...not bad. [joints cracking] [revving sounds]
rainbow Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!
rainbow Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn. [blows whistle]
rainbow [hushed, to Twilight Sparkle] No, you tell her!
rainbow Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5.
rainbow Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
rainbow But I need you!
rainbow This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
rainbow [squirrel chittering]
rainbow You did awesome, Fluttershy.
rainbow So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
rainbow Well, uh... I'd feel... um...
rainbow  If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
rainbow [ponies cheering]
rainbow Are we ready to do this?
rainbow Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
rainbow Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
rainbow Phew!
rainbow No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!
rainbow Yaa- oof!
rainbow  I'm fine!
rainbow Rbbbb- We've got to try again!
rainbow 
rainbow No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
rainbow Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
rainbow C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
rainbow Whoa, girl, take it easy!
rainbow Yeah, we did it! You did it!
rainbow Ah!
rainbow Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!
rainbow You guys!
rainbow The new Gabby Gums just came out! “The Great and Powerful Trixie's secrets revealed!”
rainbow  Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.
rainbow Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
rainbow It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof.
rainbow 
rainbow  Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me.
rainbow  Well, my life is officially over. Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.
rainbow I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late!  I'm a laughing stock!
rainbow Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums.
rainbow Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
rainbow 
rainbow [rain falling]
rainbow  I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
rainbow So...
rainbow Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed.
rainbow What happened?
rainbow I-I don't even like cake!
rainbow I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!
rainbow Ow! Cut it out!
rainbow Aw nuts, so did I.
rainbow And boy was it!
rainbow Yeah, I just dove right in!
rainbow Sorry Pinkie.
rainbow 
rainbow Yes!
rainbow A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say “best wedding ever”!
rainbow Whoa, what's with all the guards?
rainbow Sorry Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
rainbow You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
rainbow Rarity!
rainbow Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
rainbow Best - wedding - ever!
rainbow Crystal what?
rainbow A way to protect the empire! You know anything about it or what?
rainbow Hold on! You gotta know something!
rainbow It says that they liked jousting
rainbow Oh, we have to get this right
rainbow Yes we have to make them see
rainbow We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
rainbow Oh, we have to get this right
rainbow Yes we have to make them see
rainbow We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
rainbow Let's do this!
