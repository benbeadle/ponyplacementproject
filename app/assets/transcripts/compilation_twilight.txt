twilight ...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
twilight Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
twilight I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
twilight Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
twilight There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
twilight Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
twilight No, no, no... no, no, no!  Spike!
twilight Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?
twilight Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal!  Spike! Do you know what this means?
twilight Take a note please, to the Princess.
twilight My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
twilight Threshold.
twilight Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
twilight Great! Send it.
twilight Of course!
twilight That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!
twilight Important!
twilight Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
twilight See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
twilight Mm-hm!
twilight Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
twilight She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
twilight Thank you, sirs.
twilight Um... hello?
twilight Well, that was interesting all right.
twilight  Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle-
twilight Friends? Actually, I-
twilight [clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?
twilight As long as it doesn't take too long...
twilight [triangle ringing]
twilight Thanks, but I really need to hurry-
twilight  [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.
twilight Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...
twilight ...fine.
twilight Ugh... I ate too much pie...
twilight Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight Nng.
twilight Nnnn.
twilight Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
twilight I heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear.  I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather.
twilight Practicing for what?
twilight The Wonderbolts?
twilight The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
twilight Pfft, please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
twilight Prove it.
twilight [whooshing noises]
twilight Rrgh.
twilight Yes, the decor is coming along nicely. This oughta be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.
twilight Good afternoon-
twilight Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!
twilight Wait! Where are we going?! Help!
twilight  I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to-
twilight Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
twilight Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
twilight Hello!
twilight Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful.  I'm Twilight Sparkle.  What's your name?
twilight I'm sorry, what was that?
twilight Didn't quite catch that.
twilight  Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!
twilight Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy.
twilight Well, in that case we'd better be going.
twilight 
twilight I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
twilight Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
twilight Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!
twilight [door slamming]
twilight Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?
twilight 
twilight Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight [door opens, music gets louder]
twilight No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
twilight [mockingly imitates Spike]
twilight [door closes, music stops]
twilight Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old ponytale...
twilight This can't be good.
twilight Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
twilight I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!
twilight [ponies gasping]
twilight You're here to... to... 
twilight "Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon"?
twilight She will bring about nighttime eternal.
twilight It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
twilight See? I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
twilight All the ponies in this town are crazy!
twilight I hope the Princess was right.
twilight Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
twilight You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?
twilight I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them, I don't even know what they do!
twilight How did you find that?!
twilight Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now--
twilight Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own.
twilight 
twilight So, none of you have been in here before?
twilight What's that supposed to mean?
twilight 
twilight Applejack! What do I do?
twilight Are you crazy?
twilight That's not true!
twilight  Phew-wah!
twilight Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta-  A manticore!
twilight We've gotta get past him!
twilight Rainbow!
twilight How did you know about the thorn?
twilight That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
twilight Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
twilight Tell me she's not...
twilight Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
twilight Rarity, what are you-
twilight Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
twilight  We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
twilight There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it.
twilight We're almost there. Whoa!
twilight Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them.
twilight The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!
twilight The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.
twilight I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
twilight Aah!
twilight The Elements!
twilight [All five ponies talking over each other: >Fluttershy
twilight Twilight? >Applejack
twilight What? >Rarity
twilight Where did she go? >Pinkie Pie
twilight What happened? >Rainbow Dash
twilight What's going on?]
twilight [coughs, gasps]
twilight 
twilight  Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!
twilight  But... where's the sixth Element?!
twilight  You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here.
twilight Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty!
twilight Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness!
twilight Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter!
twilight Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity!
twilight And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty!
twilight The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
twilight But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all are...my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!
twilight  Princess Celestia.
twilight But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
twilight That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
twilight Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.
twilight Puh-leez, Spike, you've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.
twilight [stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food.
twilight Oh Spike, that looks delicious. Spike.
twilight It's a letter from Princess Celestia.
twilight  The Grand Galloping Gala!
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight The Grand Galloping Gala! 
twilight Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?
twilight Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.
twilight Oh, well in that case, would you like to--
twilight Yeah, but--
twilight Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?
twilight Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles]  Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?
twilight I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?
twilight Um, actually--
twilight Uh--
twilight Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
twilight Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful?
twilight Rainbow Dash, were you following me?
twilight Applejack, were you following me too?
twilight Girls, there's no use in arguing.
twilight Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo.
twilight [ponies grumble]
twilight And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.
twilight  Spike, what am I gonna do? All five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. Applejack, or Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity... Oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]
twilight I CAN'T DECIDE!
twilight Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
twilight What do you think, Spike?
twilight I mean about the gala and the ticket and who I should take.
twilight Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I--
twilight Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
twilight [ponies galloping]
twilight It's not raining. What's going on?
twilight Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?
twilight Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?
twilight Uh-huh.
twilight Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.
twilight That's better. 
twilight No, really?
twilight Heh heh, oops, sorry.
twilight Uh...
twilight Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.
twilight Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?
twilight  Oh, Spike.
twilight Wait, The Grand--
twilight I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch.
twilight You've got to be kidding me!
twilight [stomach grumbles]
twilight No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!
twilight Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.
twilight  Fluttershy, not you too?
twilight It's summer.
twilight You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
twilight No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
twilight Pinkie...
twilight Pinkie.
twilight Pinkie!
twilight At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
twilight We're... gonna... run!
twilight 
twilight [ponies offer favors]
twilight I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!
twilight Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala.
twilight If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.
twilight Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.
twilight It's okay girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all.
twilight A letter from the princess? That was fast.
twilight Now we can all go.
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight [stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]
twilight Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
twilight We all ready?
twilight Is Applejack all set?
twilight Welcome everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--
twilight Exactly. And...
twilight What does that have to do with Applejack?
twilight Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--
twilight --rupted.
twilight Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind.
twilight Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
twilight Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--
twilight Hmm.
twilight What on Earth is that pony doing?
twilight Hey Applejack!
twilight Applejack.
twilight Applejack. AppleJACK!
twilight What is all this?
twilight Applewhat season?
twilight But why are you doing it all alone?
twilight What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
twilight Fine.
twilight I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
twilight Do you... want some help?
twilight But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
twilight Uhm... no?
twilight Can I help you?
twilight Applejack?
twilight Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?
twilight No. Can we talk?
twilight No! I need to talk to you.
twilight I need to talk to you!
twilight Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
twilight Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
twilight Because you're working too hard and you need help.
twilight HELP! You need HELP!
twilight Ugh.
twilight We came as soon as we heard.
twilight Oh no! What happened?
twilight Applejack.
twilight Applejack, we need to talk.
twilight Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
twilight Here, let me help.
twilight AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
twilight Actually Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--
twilight But if you'd just let me help--
twilight Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
twilight [mule neighing]
twilight No offense.
twilight  
twilight I don't get it.
twilight Alright. Enough is enough.
twilight Alright, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.
twilight Applejack. Applejack.
twilight Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help any pony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
twilight I am not taking "no" for an answer--what?
twilight  
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help any pony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
twilight Your faithful student,
twilight Twilight Sparkle
twilight A bit?
twilight Uh-huh.
twilight Uh-huh. Phew.
twilight Isn't she right up there?
twilight Hmm?
twilight So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
twilight You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.
twilight Well, I think... you're jealous.
twilight Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.
twilight 
twilight You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
twilight Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike. She is the guest of honor after all.
twilight Spike.
twilight Wow, what was that about?
twilight [ponies talking indistinctly]
twilight Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks likes I'm the one who misjudged you.
twilight Dearest Princess Celestia,
twilight Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and the one who is true will surely come to light.
twilight Your faithful student,
twilight Twilight Sparkle
twilight Okay, here goes.
twilight [magical chime]
twilight Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.
twilight 
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
twilight Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.
twilight Really?
twilight Where is this unicorn?
twilight There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?
twilight Spike! Shhh!
twilight You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
twilight 
twilight There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since--
twilight 
twilight 
twilight I-- I--
twilight Uh...
twilight Nothing.
twilight What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
twilight I'm not better than anyone.
twilight Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.
twilight Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.
twilight No, Spike, it's exactly the same.
twilight I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
twilight [door slam, door open]
twilight Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!
twilight I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!
twilight Uh, is that what I think it is?
twilight What's going on?
twilight You what!?!
twilight 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight [music from broken cattails]
twilight 
twilight I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.
twilight Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--
twilight So, you don't mind my magic tricks?
twilight You are?
twilight That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
twilight That wasn't an Ursa Major, it was a baby, an Ursa Minor.
twilight And it wasn't rampaging, it was just cranky because someone woke it up.
twilight You don't wanna know.
twilight Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.
twilight For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?
twilight I think you're right.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.
twilight Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?
twilight You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself.
twilight Uh, not this again!
twilight Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
twilight But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
twilight It's coming from a dragon.
twilight Sleeping.
twilight According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke.
twilight We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
twilight All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour.
twilight All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
twilight The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
twilight Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way.
twilight Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that.
twilight Uh-huh.
twilight Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
twilight Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone.
twilight Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.
twilight All right girls, move out!
twilight That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
twilight Girls, this is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?
twilight Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?
twilight Your turn, Fluttershy.
twilight Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.
twilight We don't have time for this.
twilight You've got it.
twilight Just don't look down.
twilight  Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide.
twilight Shhh!
twilight Oh no! Help! Ooh!
twilight 
twilight Thanks to you I am.
twilight Yeah, we'll just have to  climb over.
twilight 
twilight We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.
twilight Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
twilight [squeaky toy]
twilight Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?
twilight 
twilight Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on!  We have to do this!  Now! Every  second longer that dragon  sleeps is another  acre of Equestria that is covered in  smoke. Ooh!
twilight What?
twilight But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
twilight But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?
twilight Oh, Fluttershy.
twilight I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing. Right?
twilight [ponies agree nervously]
twilight Mr. Dragon.
twilight Excuse me.
twilight Mr. Dragon.
twilight Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight--
twilight Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come her to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke.  Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?
twilight So, you'll find another place to sleep? 
twilight 
twilight You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
twilight Rainbow! No!
twilight You did it! I knew you could do it.
twilight Spike, take a letter.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
twilight Always your faithful student,
twilight Twilight Sparkle.
twilight Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
twilight Come inside girls, quick.
twilight It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
twilight Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
twilight Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight.  You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those.
twilight My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!
twilight We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book.
twilight Hurray slumber party!
twilight [loud chewing] Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.
twilight This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
twilight This is so awesome!  Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?
twilight I've got one! This story is called The Legend of the Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...
twilight ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was -- the Headless Horse!
twilight Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?
twilight Ooo!
twilight S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.
twilight Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever any pony dares you to do.
twilight You have to. It's the rule.
twilight Um, do I ever get a turn?
twilight I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?
twilight Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?
twilight  Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
twilight Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!
twilight I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?  Sorry I asked.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!
twilight Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
twilight Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?
twilight Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either.
twilight  Nope.
twilight  No! Only three of your twenty questions left!
twilight Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
twilight Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!
twilight That's it!
twilight No.  It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together.
twilight See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
twilight I declare my first slumber party a success!
twilight Have fun, check.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you'd just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.
twilight So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?
twilight Wow, what a gorgeous day!
twilight I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
twilight Not that I know of.
twilight Not more than usual.
twilight Uh... not very likely.
twilight 
twilight Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?
twilight  Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?
twilight Well, I saw her glance this way...
twilight ... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
twilight 
twilight [Everyone but Twilight gasp]
twilight Will you cut that out?
twilight She's a zebra.
twilight A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with.
twilight Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a far away land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?
twilight Spike!
twilight Wow. Catchy.
twilight This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
twilight  Oooooh.
twilight  Oh, my.
twilight  Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?
twilight And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?
twilight I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.
twilight You ponies are being ridiculous!
twilight Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!
twilight Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back.
twilight  Oh brother.
twilight You guys, there's no such thing as curses!
twilight My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.
twilight Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa!  Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!
twilight No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
twilight I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
twilight "Supernaturals"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!
twilight Pinkie? What happened?
twilight But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
twilight Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not gonna to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?
twilight [Sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!
twilight It's not a curse!
twilight It's not a hex either!
twilight [Everyone but Apple Bloom and Spike shouting at once]
twilight ... or sat on her?
twilight Apple Bloom is gone too!
twilight Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go.
twilight C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
twilight Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.
twilight Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?  Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?
twilight Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
twilight What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?
twilight [All ponies scream]
twilight What have you done with Apple Bloom?
twilight We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
twilight You ruined my horn!
twilight Where is Apple Bloom!?
twilight Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
twilight Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.
twilight I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes that played on us.
twilight But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
twilight But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
twilight Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals: Natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super. I...I... I'm so sorry Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.
twilight Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
twilight Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.
twilight Daisy, we need to talk.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight my friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; It's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
twilight Oh! Hurry up Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
twilight Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
twilight There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
twilight Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
twilight Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
twilight What happened to the rest of her name?
twilight You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.
twilight That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
twilight Hello Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
twilight Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
twilight They're amazing. What are they?
twilight I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
twilight A para-what?
twilight A what?
twilight Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
twilight Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
twilight The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
twilight  The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
twilight Oh,  what's there to worry about?
twilight Spike! Wake up! What happened?
twilight Where did they come from?
twilight The princess will be here in a few hours.
twilight Spike, help me round up these little guys.
twilight 
twilight Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
twilight ...or not.
twilight Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
twilight 
twilight If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
twilight  I got it! No pony can herd like Applejack.
twilight Pinkie!
twilight You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
twilight Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
twilight We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
twilight Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
twilight Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
twilight Where did they come from?
twilight We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
twilight  Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
twilight Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
twilight Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
twilight We've gotta do something.  I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight  They're eating the words. 
twilight Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
twilight I don't know! Is it?
twilight 
twilight  Oh no, here she comes.
twilight [ponies scream]
twilight Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
twilight Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over.
twilight [polka music]
twilight Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
twilight Look.
twilight Hello, princess.
twilight So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
twilight Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
twilight An... infestation?
twilight Trouble? What trouble?
twilight My... report?
twilight Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives , even when they don't always seem to make sense.
twilight Thank you, princess.
twilight Emergency in Fillydelphia.
twilight I think the princess can handle it.
twilight We know Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
twilight [>Rainbow Dash
twilight I'm sorry, Pinkie.] [>Rarity
twilight So sorry, Pinkie.] [>Fluttershy
twilight Sorry, Pinkie.] [>Applejack
twilight Real sorry, Pinkie.]
twilight You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
twilight You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.
twilight ...Or not.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight  Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!
twilight Winter Wrap Up!
twilight Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so every pony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready.
twilight No Spike, Ponyville was started by Earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. It's traditional. 
twilight Okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early.
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.
twilight Oh, this is so exciting.
twilight Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?
twilight The time has come to welcome spring
twilight And all things warm and green
twilight But it's also time to say goodbye
twilight It's winter we must clean
twilight How can I help? I'm new, you see
twilight What does everypony do?
twilight How do I fit in without magic?
twilight I haven't got a clue!
twilight Now that I know what they all do
twilight I have to find my place
twilight And help with all of my heart
twilight Tough task ahead I face
twilight How will I do without my magic
twilight Help the Earth pony way
twilight I wanna belong so I must
twilight Do my best today,
twilight Do my best today!
twilight 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
twilight 'Cause tomorrow spring is here
twilight 'Cause tomorrow spring is here!
twilight Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?
twilight Rainbow Dash!
twilight What are you doing?
twilight Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?
twilight Right. No wings.
twilight  Great, now what do we do?
twilight Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow.
twilight Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with.
twilight Birds' nests?
twilight Wow Rarity, that one's really beautiful.
twilight Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
twilight There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
twilight Hw...
twilight Wow Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.
twilight How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.
twilight Would I?
twilight Okay.
twilight Uh... maybe on second thought.
twilight Oh no, whoa, wow...
twilight Yaaaaa!
twilight Really?
twilight Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess.
twilight Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.
twilight Yaaaaaa!
twilight Awww, how cute.
twilight Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.
twilight Okay, let's start there.
twilight [bell rings]
twilight Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. [bell rings] I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken.
twilight Waaa! Snakes! Snakes!  Ugh!   Ugh!
twilight 
twilight  All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
twilight No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.
twilight No, no, no! I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me. 
twilight Hey Applejack. How's everything going?
twilight Well, I'd like to help.
twilight Just give me a chance.
twilight  Ugh...  Ugh... 
twilight I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
twilight  Uh oh. Slow down. Slow down!
twilight Well, see, I just wanted to... 
twilight I'm a winter mess up.
twilight  Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
twilight Did she say late?
twilight Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!
twilight Stop everypony. [ponies argue] Stop. [bird chirps] Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job.
twilight It was a team effort.
twilight Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you everypony.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?
twilight Oh, Spike. 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight [school bell rings]
twilight [students chatter happily]
twilight Whoa, what's been going on in here?
twilight Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.
twilight What's the matter?
twilight Uhhh… I don't follow. How can I help you?
twilight Oh no Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.
twilight I'm sorry but-
twilight Alright alright!
twilight I'm sorry sweetie, but I told you-
twilight 
twilight            
twilight Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
twilight I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
twilight I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
twilight They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.
twilight Dearest Princess Celestia,
twilight I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
twilight So you two are doing what, now?
twilight And I'm here to...?
twilight Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?
twilight Ready. Set. Go!
twilight Time, Spike?
twilight Ready. Set. Go!
twilight Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
twilight Go!
twilight Go!
twilight Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
twilight Who are you talking to?
twilight 95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!
twilight All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got.
twilight Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
twilight Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.
twilight I'm racing.
twilight I'm not joking.
twilight I am not an egghead, I am well read.
twilight Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.
twilight Books. I've read several on the subject.
twilight Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the running of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.
twilight I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
twilight She did not.
twilight She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
twilight Just be careful!
twilight Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
twilight Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.
twilight Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.
twilight Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?
twilight Except that the other racers just passed you.
twilight Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?
twilight Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering that I've never run a race before.
twilight Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.
twilight Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.
twilight It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
twilight Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
twilight Looks like a dress.
twilight Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
twilight Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
twilight But...
twilight Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
twilight What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
twilight Wow... They're...
twilight Yes! Something.
twilight They're very nice...
twilight I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
twilight [collective yeah]
twilight Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.
twilight Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.
twilight That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
twilight Gotta balance style with adherence
twilight Oh my!
twilight Thank you, Rarity.
twilight The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
twilight Wow!
twilight Oh dear.
twilight You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...
twilight Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
twilight Now what do we do?
twilight She only has one cat.
twilight Like you should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
twilight Maybe not.
twilight "Dear Princess Celestia. This week my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. And I learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth." 
twilight Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
twilight [magic chimes]
twilight Eyes over here, Spike!
twilight For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-
twilight Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
twilight Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
twilight Pinkie Pie? What in the wide-wide-world of Equestria are you up to?
twilight Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.
twilight Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!
twilight Of course you did.
twilight Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?
twilight C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.
twilight Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it.
twilight Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna FA-aaah!
twilight Oh, please.
twilight Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.
twilight Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?
twilight Huh?  A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
twilight 
twilight 
twilight Phhhhft.
twilight Is your knee pinchy now?
twilight  How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!
twilight Okay, okay... I get it.
twilight Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
twilight Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!
twilight Combos?
twilight Yeah, sure.
twilight Ugh!
twilight [beeping noises of a truck backing up]
twilight Ughhh... You said that combo meant 'beautiful rainbow'.
twilight I don't believe this.
twilight Hmm...
twilight Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
twilight Any twitches yet?
twilight Now? Anything?
twilight Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of non-stop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?
twilight That makes no sense!
twilight I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
twilight Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!
twilight [Pinkie Pie's stomach growls]
twilight Urgh... You know what?   Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care!
twilight Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
twilight Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.
twilight [frog croaks]
twilight [frogs croaking]
twilight Ah!
twilight Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?
twilight  No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Piecus, in its natural habitat.
twilight There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Piecus is on the move.
twilight Hm... Itchy nose...
twilight A-ha, that makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall out of the sky, but a twitchy tail means that something's about to fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.
twilight [theremin music]
twilight [swarm of bees buzzing]
twilight This proves...
twilight ...perhaps conclusively, that--
twilight Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific--
twilight [swarm buzzing]
twilight [comical "sting" noises]
twilight Ow! Ouch! Ow! 
twilight Smelling a flower.
twilight Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.
twilight Oh, ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that-- Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!
twilight Okay, take this down: twitchy tail.
twilight Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?
twilight Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact--
twilight 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight 
twilight Ugh!
twilight You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?
twilight Urgh!
twilight Calm down everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.
twilight I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
twilight Cold? Need a jacket or something?
twilight Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.
twilight Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... AHA! I told you there was nothing to worry about and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a  doozy, and  and the only  doozy here is how right I am.
twilight Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but  ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing  in anything you can't see for yourself.
twilight I see it... But I don't believe it!
twilight [Hydra roars]
twilight Pinkie! Come on!
twilight Everypony up that hill!
twilight Coming, Spike! Hang on!
twilight [hydra growls]
twilight I think we're gonna make it.
twilight Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!
twilight No.
twilight No!
twilight No small rodents of any kind!
twilight Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? CHAAARGE!
twilight [hydra chirps]
twilight 
twilight I'll never make it!
twilight I will not!
twilight [hydra roars]
twilight 
twilight 
twilight Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
twilight [ponies cheer]
twilight I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra--
twilight Pinkie?
twilight Huh?
twilight Huh? But I-- WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
twilight Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...
twilight The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
twilight Eyup, I guess I do.
twilight What? What is?
twilight Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that-- Spike, what have I been saying about focus?
twilight What's wrong Spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
twilight Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
twilight 
twilight "I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
twilight "Always, your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
twilight I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
twilight  Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books guys. It was a crazy week of studying.
twilight 
twilight What are you two arguing about?
twilight What's that?
twilight What's a sonic rainboom?
twilight Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!
twilight Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.
twilight Go on what?
twilight Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
twilight Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.
twilight Ok... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
twilight Heere goes. [grunts and screams]
twilight I think it worked!
twilight I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
twilight Yes!
twilight Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.
twilight Rarity. We're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!
twilight Rainbow Dash. Are you ok? You don't look so good.
twilight I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel-rolls in a row can't be easy.
twilight Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
twilight 
twilight Princess.
twilight I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.
twilight Hello, Fluttershy.
twilight I'm heading to the Everfree Forest, to Zecora's, to get some of my favorite tea.
twilight Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
twilight Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
twilight What... what happened?
twilight [chicken squawking]
twilight This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
twilight Hmm? How so?
twilight You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity.
twilight 
twilight [closing credits]
twilight What is going on here?
twilight Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?
twilight My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
twilight "Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?
twilight What do you think they're up to?
twilight My little ponies! How are you doing?
twilight Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.
twilight Oh?
twilight Oh?
twilight Costumes?
twilight Really, girls? Are you sure...
twilight Break a le...
twilight Uh... good luck!
twilight Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.
twilight Hey, you don't sound too excited.
twilight Oh, girls...
twilight Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
twilight Yes? And...
twilight Yes? Yes?
twilight And that is...?
twilight One day...  One day...
twilight 
twilight Spike, can you breathe now?
twilight Good. Now tell us what you know.
twilight Creepy guys?
twilight Come on, girls! Let's get started.
twilight Hello!
twilight Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
twilight Oh, Rarity...
twilight  Ooh.
twilight Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
twilight Spike, it is very noble of you...
twilight  ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
twilight Applejack!
twilight Um... Which way do we go?
twilight All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
twilight But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.
twilight Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
twilight We're getting close. I can feel it.
twilight [Rarity crying]
twilight And just what do you think you're doing?
twilight Eh... fine. 
twilight Excuse me?
twilight I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
twilight Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
twilight Oh, doesn't that hurt?
twilight I promise.
twilight Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you...
twilight But...
twilight My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
twilight 
twilight She hardly took any pictures.
twilight Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?
twilight I'm sure she just got tied up.
twilight Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
twilight You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
twilight Wow! You look great!
twilight Sorry.
twilight Feel better?
twilight Of course.
twilight I swear.
twilight Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [pokes her eye] AARGH!
twilight Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...
twilight [Pinkie Pie disapproves]
twilight Nothing!
twilight I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.
twilight But Rarity told me...
twilight [Pinkie Pie eats an apple in a menacing way]
twilight Uhhhhhh..
twilight I guess you're right.  You're right. You're right, you're fight, you're right!
twilight Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive on her next fashion show, no one would ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?
twilight So you do promise or you don't?
twilight Obviously.
twilight They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
twilight But Rarity...! [covers mouth]
twilight Because you ha...! [covers mouth]
twilight Of course she did! Because...! [covers mouth]
twilight But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh! [puts her head into a flower pot]
twilight Spike has a crush on Rarity! [covers mouth]
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.
twilight Did you get all that, Spike?
twilight You're right. That was wrong of me and I'm very sorry.
twilight Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
twilight 
twilight 
twilight Uhh... Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
twilight What's going on?
twilight Did you say she was a tree?
twilight Ya know she's not a tree, right?
twilight Well that was kind of huffy.
twilight A buffalo stampede!
twilight They're getting awfully close to the train.
twilight [all shouting indistinctly]
twilight And Spike!
twilight How did you escape from the buffalo?
twilight Look... Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
twilight We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt.
twilight Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we –
twilight If we could just sit down and talk we could –
twilight  ... Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
twilight Dear, Princess Celestia. Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care –
twilight It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.
twilight I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.
twilight Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!
twilight Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.
twilight And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
twilight Oh...
twilight  Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.
twilight Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today...  What is Celestia's pet doing here?!
twilight Oh no. NonononononoNO! This is bad.
twilight But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
twilight Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
twilight I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return Princess's pet!
twilight If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. 
twilight Really? You don't say!
twilight 
twilight 
twilight [excessive coughing]
twilight It's that dry night air.
twilight Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. BYE! Phew... What are you doing?!
twilight We can't now!
twilight You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
twilight Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to.
twilight Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?
twilight That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
twilight Did you give her any kind of medicine?
twilight Then you have to MAKE her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!
twilight No excuses!
twilight Done. Okay, what else?
twilight There you go.
twilight Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?
twilight NEXT!
twilight One step ahead of you.
twilight What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
twilight Oh, she'll eat it, all right.
twilight Hey! Where are you going?
twilight Beg your pardon!
twilight Sorry, but we've gotta find...
twilight Yes, Your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.
twilight No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.
twilight But you were only trying to help.
twilight Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
twilight No, it's my fault!
twilight Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
twilight Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?
twilight As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun.
twilight And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen. I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic. My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam!
twilight I knew this was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!
twilight ...yesyesyesyes...
twilight ...yesyes, YEEEES!
twilight  Um... yes.
twilight This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!
twilight Dear Princess Celestia.
twilight Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
twilight Just write it, Spike.
twilight 
twilight 
twilight This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
twilight You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.
twilight We better get a move on!
twilight Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
twilight Scrolls?
twilight  I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant.
twilight That is why you are my number one assistant.
twilight I said... Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot. I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy".
twilight You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?
twilight Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
twilight Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
twilight And a number one assistant, right?
twilight Spike, that's enough.
twilight Wow...
twilight Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?
twilight Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
twilight Goodnight, Spike.  Sweet dreams, number one assistant.
twilight "The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of non-volatile grains and frozen gasses. They..."
twilight "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
twilight Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
twilight Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
twilight Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?
twilight Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
twilight Spike, don't worry.
twilight It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
twilight He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
twilight Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.
twilight Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
twilight Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth...
twilight Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland too".
twilight Climb down from there before you fall.
twilight Shoot!
twilight My last writing quill. It's broken.
twilight Spike, wait! Wait!
twilight Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.
twilight Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
twilight Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
twilight Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?
twilight I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
twilight Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is NOT the Spike I know and love.
twilight Spike! Over here!
twilight Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
twilight Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
twilight Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.
twilight And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.
twilight He forgives you, Spike.
twilight It was your ketchup covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
twilight 
twilight I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
twilight Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?
twilight I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
twilight Oh, Spike.
twilight Who? Spike! You kno... Oooooh... 
twilight 
twilight Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie…
twilight [>Pinkie Pie]
twilight This is your singing telegram
twilight I hope it finds you well
twilight You're invited to a party
twilight 'Cause we think you're really swell
twilight Gummy's turning one year old
twilight So help us celebrate
twilight The cake will be delicious
twilight The festivities first-rate
twilight There will be games and dancing
twilight Bob for apples, cut a rug
twilight And when the party's over
twilight We'll gather 'round for a group hug
twilight No need to bring a gift
twilight Being there will be enough
twilight Birthdays mean having fun with friends
twilight Not getting lots of stuff
twilight It won't be the same without you
twilight So we hope that you say yes
twilight So, please, oh please R.S.V.P
twilight And come, and be our guest!
twilight A blast!
twilight Uh, I think I’m gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon.
twilight Oh! Hi, Pinki-
twilight Pardon me?
twilight “You’re invited to ‘Gummy’s After-Birthday’ party. This afternoon at 3 o’clock.”
twilight This afternoon? As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
twilight Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I’ve gotten a bit behind in my studies. I’ve really gotta hit the books.
twilight Please do.
twilight I’ll keep that in mind.
twilight Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
twilight Good. I don’t wanna her to know anything about this.
twilight Thanks, and remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie. Hey! What’s with the tin can? 
twilight I don’t think so.
twilight Me too.
twilight [in unison] Surprise!
twilight Farewell party?
twilight If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say, “Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie?”
twilight It’s okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us.
twilight Huh?!
twilight Dear Princess Celestia, I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I’m not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
twilight Yeah, why not? Let’s have a party for Gummy. 
twilight 
twilight Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.
twilight Perfect! I'm ready.
twilight All right, Spike.
twilight Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
twilight You have my word.
twilight Ta-da!
twilight [collective: Oh. Uh. Ah. That's a choice. Interesting.]
twilight Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.
twilight Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
twilight Oh. Yeah. Right.
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.
twilight I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!
twilight At the Gala
twilight At the Gala (at the Gala), with the Princess (with the Princess)
twilight Is where I'm going to be (she will be)
twilight We will talk all about magic and what I've learned and seen (she will see)
twilight It is going to be so special as she takes time just for me!
twilight To talk!
twilight Princess Celestia!
twilight Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.
twilight That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
twilight Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
twilight  Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
twilight This isn't what I hoped.
twilight No!
twilight ...I'm gonna make this...
twilight Well... it can't get any worse.
twilight Uh... Eek!
twilight 
twilight I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
twilight Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.
twilight It is?
twilight You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
twilight Yes, Spike. You were right.
twilight Don't worry everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything.
twilight My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?
twilight Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky?
twilight Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth.
twilight 
twilight You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.
twilight  Come on girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!
twilight Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could.
twilight Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there–
twilight No longer connected?
twilight But why us? Why don't you-
twilight Princess Celestia, you can count on–
twilight Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again.
twilight The elements! They're gone!
twilight You seem to know our strengths, too?
twilight Pinkie!
twilight Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the elements in the palace labyrinth!
twilight Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.
twilight Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
twilight Give us our wings and horns back!
twilight Never fear, girls. We have each other!
twilight All right, girls, let's do this!
twilight Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!
twilight Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
twilight What?
twilight Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie.
twilight Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
twilight Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
twilight Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
twilight Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
twilight Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to every pony.
twilight [Pinkie blows a raspberry at Twilight]
twilight Uh...
twilight What is happening to my friends?
twilight You're welcome–
twilight Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
twilight Now I know that's a lie.  How can it be?
twilight [thunder, cracking]
twilight Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could.
twilight The Elements! They're gone!
twilight Who are you talking to?
twilight What? Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
twilight What is happening to my friends?
twilight Girls, why are you all acting like this?
twilight We need to stick together.
twilight Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair.
twilight How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
twilight But...but..
twilight  Think, Twilight, think! "Find the Elements back where you began." Back where you began.
twilight Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute...home! "Back where you began!" The Elements must be in Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know could give us a clue. Ah!
twilight Wah! Ahh! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap.
twilight Ugh.
twilight I can't picture anything. It's too dark. 
twilight Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it.
twilight  Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?
twilight 
twilight Pleeeease, we've gotta hurry!
twilight Tom?
twilight You're not going in without him, are you?
twilight  Fine!
twilight Oh, for the love of...
twilight Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
twilight Fluttershy, I've had just about enough... 
twilight Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret.
twilight Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!
twilight Hey! Applejack, give me that book!
twilight Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
twilight Hey, do you even know what you just stole?
twilight [strained groan] Give me that book! Where is she? Where's Rarity?
twilight Lies!
twilight [cat yowl, fighting noises]
twilight Get back! All of you! This is my book. And I'm going to READ IT!  The Elements!
twilight The Elements! They were here all along!
twilight See girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!
twilight You don't even care, do you?
twilight  I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on everypony, let's go!
twilight Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder and the brute. That just about covers it.
twilight Congratulations Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!
twilight Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!
twilight Move! Look out, here comes Tom!
twilight 
twilight Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
twilight Formation, now!
twilight Rainbow Dash, get over here. All right, let's get this over with.
twilight What's going on?
twilight 
twilight Who are you talking to?
twilight FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...?
twilight Not anymore...
twilight Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving.
twilight Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here.
twilight These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
twilight "Real friends don't care what your cover is. Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. And like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through. The best thing to do is stay true to yourself. Everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. Maybe even before she's met them."
twilight Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Night Mare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!
twilight You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!
twilight Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
twilight Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship.
twilight Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
twilight I already have. Come on!
twilight Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.
twilight Rainbow Dash!
twilight We've been looking everywhere for you!
twilight Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, loyalty!
twilight Time for Plan B.
twilight Ugh...
twilight Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah!
twilight If you can't catch her, Discord wins!
twilight Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!
twilight Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
twilight Not as wonderful as friendship.
twilight I'll tell you what we've learned Discord. We've learned that friendship isn't always easy. But there's no doubt it's worth fighting for.
twilight All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!
twilight Quill.
twilight Parchment.
twilight Extra ink.
twilight Extra extra ink.
twilight Is that everything on the checklist?
twilight Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?
twilight Item 1: Create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
twilight How are we doing Spike?
twilight Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
twilight Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
twilight Uh, I only ordered twelve.
twilight Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?
twilight It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
twilight Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!
twilight Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list. Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
twilight Almost everything!
twilight We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
twilight Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every 10 days, every single week!
twilight Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!
twilight When did we send the last one?
twilight And today is...
twilight Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!
twilight Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment.
twilight I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?
twilight What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
twilight What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?!
twilight She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
twilight Huh?
twilight You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
twilight So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend can help you solve?
twilight  Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
twilight You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!
twilight Rarity!
twilight Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!
twilight What's happened? Are you alright?
twilight Never fear Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi--
twilight So... you just lost your ribbon?
twilight ...but now you've found it?
twilight ...and nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend could help you with?
twilight Yes?
twilight  Measuring tape? Sure.
twilight No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
twilight What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! Oh wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.
twilight Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight. Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack.
twilight You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
twilight 
twilight 
twilight  I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her.
twilight Fluttershy?
twilight How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!
twilight It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!  It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can. You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
twilight Huh?
twilight The picnic! I should go see my friends!
twilight No! I am not alright.
twilight It's just terrible.
twilight Simply awful.
twilight It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
twilight My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!
twilight [strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!
twilight This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
twilight [annoyed groans]
twilight Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!
twilight [insane giggles]
twilight Hi girls!
twilight Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!
twilight She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!
twilight I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?
twilight (thinking) I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think!  That's it! (normal) Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything.
twilight The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?
twilight [annoyed groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
twilight Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?
twilight Oh no!
twilight Can't... get... a clear shot! 
twilight Oh, what have I done?!
twilight Don't look at it!
twilight My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
twilight Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!
twilight Goodbye girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot.
twilight ...But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
twilight Really?
twilight Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?
twilight 
twilight I'm Star Swirl the Bearded. Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
twilight Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.
twilight Since you moved here from Trottingham?
twilight Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?
twilight [bell jingles] Do you like it?
twilight A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
twilight 
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
twilight He created more than 200 spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?
twilight Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?
twilight Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice.
twilight Look what you did to Spike.
twilight Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!
twilight She means me, Spike.
twilight 
twilight Princess Luna!
twilight I'm gonna go talk to her.
twilight No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good! But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.
twilight Princess Luna? Hi, my name is-
twilight Thank you, finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is-
twilight And that was a good thing, right?
twilight Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.
twilight You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.
twilight Lower the volume..?
twilight Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice.
twilight Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!
twilight [nervous laughter] Wait right here.
twilight 
twilight Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
twilight A little quieter, princess.
twilight Better. Right, Fluttershy?
twilight Now you're getting it.
twilight Yes! Well done.
twilight Come on, princess. Time for plan B.
twilight My friend Applejack is one of the most likeable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
twilight Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.
twilight 
twilight Fire away, princess!
twilight Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!
twilight It's not over yet.
twilight I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
twilight Princess.
twilight Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.
twilight [with regret] Princess...
twilight No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay?
twilight There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?
twilight Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?
twilight Rainbow!
twilight She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!
twilight Huh?
twilight So why do you keep running away and screaming?
twilight Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!
twilight Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
twilight Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
twilight Just wait.
twilight See? They really do like you, princess.
twilight Dear Princess Celestia,
twilight When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem - your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!
twilight 
twilight Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
twilight Yes, Spike, you're amazing!
twilight Hay fever... the trots...  Cutie pox!
twilight Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the paleopony period!
twilight Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!
twilight It says here there's no known cure!
twilight The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!
twilight She needs help!
twilight Not some pony... some zebra!
twilight Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
twilight Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?
twilight Well we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except–
twilight Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection- ugh! And breath mints!
twilight Aren't those all the same thing?
twilight Hm, something's not right here.
twilight Tortoise!
twilight And he's carrying something on his back...
twilight Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!
twilight But what about the--
twilight Tenacity.
twilight I can think of a few new words.
twilight No, but she is kinda awesome.
twilight [old ponies chattering]
twilight [splintering wood]
twilight Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.
twilight Mm-hm.
twilight Are you taking notes?
twilight Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about...
twilight I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.
twilight Sounds like somepony's jealous.
twilight Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.
twilight And I used my magic to fix the dam.
twilight Of course we want you to be a hero.
twilight Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
twilight What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.
twilight Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
twilight When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!
twilight Is... that my dress?
twilight It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
twilight When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot castle ballroom!
twilight I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
twilight [ponies chattering]
twilight (blowing a party trumpet)
twilight Were you at that other party in the garden?
twilight Rarity, I'm surprised at you.
twilight I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
twilight All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!
twilight Oh, well you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!
twilight Understand what?
twilight Why yes, yes you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.
twilight I do say. Her name is-
twilight Oh don't be so modest, this dress you made is beautiful!
twilight [ponies gasp]
twilight [glass shattering]
twilight We all think so!
twilight No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day. Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... actually, I kinda wanna read that again.
twilight Spike! What are you laughing at?
twilight 
twilight [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
twilight Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
twilight Start with this one.
twilight Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!
twilight Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon.
twilight Not quite everything.
twilight It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!
twilight Never!
twilight Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away.
twilight What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
twilight No problem. See you at home later?
twilight Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea--
twilight I can't believe you! Where'd you get all this-- 
twilight I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
twilight Spike!
twilight You went to talk to who?
twilight Huh?
twilight 
twilight Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!
twilight 
twilight This is Spike.  And something's wrong with him.  He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't  his!
twilight So? What do you think, Doctor?
twilight That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
twilight  Okay. Thank you, doctor.
twilight Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.
twilight [squee, squeaks]
twilight [watch ticking]
twilight Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
twilight  You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?
twilight [laughs nervously]
twilight Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!
twilight [sing-song voice] C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!
twilight Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh Spike, I just re-shelved this room!
twilight [door closes]
twilight 
twilight  What now?
twilight Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!
twilight Help!
twilight Fluttershy? Fluttershy!?
twilight What happened?
twilight That was Spike!
twilight C'mon, girls!
twilight Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
twilight He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
twilight We're getting closer!
twilight Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?
twilight I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane.
twilight I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
twilight Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!
twilight PINKIE!
twilight Yes, your majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?
twilight About five minutes, your highness.
twilight I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
twilight What's wrong?
twilight Your highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily.
twilight 
twilight What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down...
twilight Look, everypony! The entrance!
twilight [ice cracking]
twilight  
twilight [windigo roaring]
twilight 
twilight They must be... windigos!
twilight My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!
twilight And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
twilight 
twilight [windigo snorts]
twilight 
twilight Nor do I.
twilight I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.
twilight We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
twilight [wind blowing]
twilight Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
twilight And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
twilight I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.
twilight Hi! I finished up the work I had to do so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!
twilight It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.
twilight Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
twilight I'm happy to help! It's no trouble-
twilight [door slams]
twilight Just do your best, Applejack.
twilight Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!
twilight It's from Applejack. “Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville.”
twilight “...Don't worry, will send money soon.” That's all there is.
twilight Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
twilight I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
twilight This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her.
twilight Tell us what happened, Applejack!
twilight Yes ma'am.
twilight I don't care what she says, Applejack's not telling us something.
twilight We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
twilight ...So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town.
twilight Was the rodeo fun?
twilight Did you meet some nice ponies there?
twilight So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
twilight Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
twilight Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.
twilight I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
twilight Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!
twilight We'll pay you triple to slow down!
twilight Rainbow, go back!
twilight Know what?
twilight I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!
twilight Applejack, you're not a failure.
twilight Nn-nn.
twilight Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!
twilight Still worried about Flim and Flam?
twilight Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!
twilight Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
twilight Well, good luck.
twilight Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?
twilight Okay everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.
twilight Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.
twilight Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.
twilight Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.
twilight Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?
twilight Alright everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!
twilight Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!
twilight C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!
twilight We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!
twilight I'm proud of you, Applejack.
twilight Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
twilight That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
twilight Hey Rarity, hey Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?
twilight 
twilight Oh no, oh no, oh no!
twilight Ohh.
twilight How is she, doctor?
twilight This is the first story in the series. I own all of them. 
twilight Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!
twilight I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.
twilight [door closes]
twilight [clock ticking]
twilight [ball bouncing]
twilight [glass clinking, sloshing etc]
twilight [light clicking]
twilight Hi Rainbow Dash!
twilight We brought your favorite board game!
twilight You go first, Rainbow Dash!
twilight Alright, uh... cloud three.
twilight Uh... cloud two?
twilight But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game of-
twilight But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
twilight Alright then.
twilight [door closes]
twilight What's going on, Rainbow Dash?
twilight -'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
twilight Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
twilight Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.
twilight Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!
twilight Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!
twilight Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
twilight That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess.
twilight Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry.
twilight I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
twilight That's right. It even has the recipe.
twilight Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll–
twilight I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered.
twilight Rainbow!
twilight Oh, hi Spike!
twilight Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!
twilight It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
twilight Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
twilight No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!
twilight Oh my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read The Art of Invisibility Spells, and Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?
twilight [magic crackling, wind blowing]
twilight What's going on? 
twilight Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two 'me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
twilight You're from the future?!
twilight What happened to you? The future must be awful.
twilight Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
twilight I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
twilight Really? Where? I've never seen them.
twilight Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions- [muffled voice]
twilight Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I... will be...  She must want me to prevent whatever horrible thing happens in the future! 
twilight Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!
twilight This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
twilight I've just been visited by myself from the future!
twilight This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
twilight I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
twilight We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything.
twilight Everypony else-
twilight Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!
twilight [cement squelching]
twilight [screw squeaking]
twilight Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?
twilight Great.
twilight Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
twilight [Cerberus roaring]
twilight That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus, but if he's here, then all of the evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!
twilight Yeah, isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!
twilight [Cerberus roaring]
twilight Huh?
twilight Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing.
twilight Pinkie.
twilight Do you have a ball I can borrow?
twilight [sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!
twilight [Cerberus panting]
twilight I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.
twilight [cockerel crowing]
twilight Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
twilight  Oh no!
twilight It's not that, it's this!
twilight The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
twilight If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?
twilight I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!
twilight I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... maybe it's what I don't do! If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!
twilight [through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!
twilight 
twilight What happened?
twilight Show me.
twilight Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
twilight I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!
twilight What's this?
twilight Madame Pinkie?
twilight Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.
twilight Yes, and?
twilight Are you sure?
twilight Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!
twilight Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
twilight Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine and quarter catadioptric telescopes?
twilight So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head, see the bandage, just like the bandage from the future...
twilight I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything.
twilight That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong!
twilight Oh I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!
twilight  Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine and quarter inch catadioptric telescopes?
twilight Ah! My eye!
twilight The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time.
twilight [train chugging]
twilight  Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!
twilight  Guard! C'mon, you guys!  That was close.
twilight  No, there's nothing fun about this!
twilight  Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!
twilight  No, it's not fun!
twilight  The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can- AH!
twilight  Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here.
twilight  What is it, Spike?
twilight I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
twilight Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
twilight  What do we do, what do we do?!
twilight [chuckles nervously] Thanks!
twilight Oh no!
twilight 
twilight Look! I look just like future Twilight... the last sign has come true!
twilight Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
twilight I. Don't. Know!
twilight [birds singing]
twilight Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!
twilight Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
twilight  I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
twilight 
twilight And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!
twilight No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.
twilight Pinkie, you're a genius!
twilight Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
twilight [magic crackling]
twilight Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
twilight Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
twilight That's right, now listen-
twilight Please! I don't have much time!
twilight Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
twilight The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not-
twilight They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to-
twilight I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't-
twilight [magic crackling]
twilight -waste your time... worrying... about... ugh, I can't believe I just did that.
twilight Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
twilight  Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.
twilight 
twilight Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home.
twilight 
twilight [digging sounds]
twilight C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!
twilight But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
twilight Aw Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.
twilight Well... yeah!
twilight 
twilight  I don't see any dragons.
twilight  No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!
twilight  You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?
twilight Wow, amazing!
twilight Or act like them.
twilight Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you, or where they found you.
twilight I'm sorry, Spike.
twilight Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.
twilight Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
twilight Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
twilight I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!
twilight Aw, Spike.
twilight That sounds great. I'm famished.
twilight What?!?
twilight Hold it!
twilight Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you.
twilight We know.
twilight Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.
twilight Quest.
twilight We have faith in you!
twilight [through her grin] Of course.
twilight [wind blowing]
twilight [rain pouring]
twilight [dragon roaring]
twilight [teacup clinking]
twilight [sounds of exertion]
twilight Shh!  We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!
twilight [dragons cheering]
twilight [deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
twilight  How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
twilight I know, I know!
twilight There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
twilight Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
twilight Oof!
twilight [pinching noise]
twilight  Spike's on his own this time.
twilight [dragons cheering]
twilight Forever?!
twilight Oh no, this is terrible!
twilight No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!
twilight  Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!
twilight Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
twilight That's right!
twilight Nyuh!
twilight 
twilight Of course. What are friends for?
twilight This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H<sub>2</sub>O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?
twilight Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment.
twilight We have 9.3 wing power.
twilight 16.5 wing power!
twilight [hushed, to Rainbow Dash] Tell her!
twilight  No, you!
twilight That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday.
twilight Do I look like I speak squirrel?
twilight Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!
twilight Let's see, with those eight sick pegasi out with the feather flu...  oh no!
twilight No...
twilight ...you might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
twilight [taps giant anemometer]
twilight I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
twilight [water churning]
twilight Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
twilight Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
twilight She could sure use it, considering eight pegasi are sick with the feather flu!
twilight Are you okay?
twilight Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
twilight But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
twilight If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!
twilight Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred... five hundred!
twilight Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
twilight Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!
twilight You can make a difference!
twilight Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
twilight It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
twilight She did it! She did it! They all did it!
twilight I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
twilight Celestia, just like us? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
twilight I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
twilight Listen to this one. “Twilight Sparkle: I was a Canterlot snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes.” Spike!
twilight How could you say such a thing?
twilight But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants, she doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! “Fluttershy has tail extensions!” “Pinkie Pie is an out-of-control party animal!”
twilight Oh look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!
twilight “Rainbow Dash: Speed demon or super softie?”?!
twilight See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!
twilight We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is!
twilight Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
twilight Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
twilight Well it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep.
twilight Pinkie... you're overreacting.
twilight Whoa!
twilight Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet Pinkie... look.
twilight You mean, who "did it."
twilight Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate.
twilight Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?
twilight Yes?
twilight Pinkie, how could you possibly know?
twilight But it makes no sense!
twilight Well first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?
twilight And second, the cake hasn't been sliced, it's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!
twilight Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system. And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!
twilight May be?
twilight Pinkie... that mousse is a moose!
twilight So you're saying that the culprit is...
twilight Pinkie stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!
twilight Thank you!
twilight Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.
twilight No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
twilight Good... let's retrace your steps.
twilight Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it Pinkie.
twilight Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.
twilight The conductor, huh?  But, that doesn't make any sense. What happened next Pinkie?
twilight Yes?
twilight Interesting. Anything else?
twilight Oh my, what is that?
twilight 
twilight [teapot whistling]
twilight What next Pinkie?
twilight And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?
twilight By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.
twilight I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
twilight We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
twilight Well you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like this.
twilight Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.
twilight No Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?
twilight Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.
twilight Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was, Fluttershy.
twilight Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?
twilight Really?
twilight But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.
twilight Well, yes I do. Do you?
twilight Well Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?
twilight What do you say bakers?
twilight Well everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.
twilight Care for a bite?
twilight Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot. [to the others] Wedding?  I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.
twilight Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.
twilight Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.
twilight Rainbow Dash-
twilight ...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their I do's.
twilight Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.
twilight And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?
twilight Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...  My brother?!
twilight [<a href="/wiki/Theme_song" title="Theme song" class="mw-redirect">theme song</a>]
twilight Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as >Shining Armor] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation.  Princess Mi Amore Cadenza? Who in the hoof is that?! 
twilight Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F!
twilight 
twilight Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
twilight Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I really accepted as a friend.
twilight When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly
twilight To see how many other ponies I could meet
twilight I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need
twilight Other ponies to make my life complete
twilight But there was one colt that I cared for
twilight I knew he would be there for me
twilight My big brother, best friend forever!
twilight Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together
twilight He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!)
twilight We never had a single fight (We did everything together!)
twilight We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
twilight I miss him more than I realized
twilight It seems...
twilight And though he's, oh, so far away
twilight I hoped that he would stay
twilight My big brother best friend
twilight Forever...
twilight Forever...
twilight He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be Captain of the Royal Guard.
twilight I guess we are.
twilight I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Cal-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other.
twilight Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
twilight Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
twilight I've got something to say to you, mister.
twilight How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister for pony's sake!
twilight Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?
twilight Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?
twilight You want me to be your best mare?
twilight I'd be honored!  But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?
twilight Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
twilight Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
twilight How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
twilight Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!
twilight Cadance, it's me, Twilight!
twilight Mmm. Check.
twilight  Did... you see what she...
twilight Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
twilight Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants."
twilight 
twilight Bet I can guess what you're all thinking! Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
twilight Rarity, she was so demanding!
twilight Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres she threw them in the trash?
twilight No, she was just being fake, and totally insincere!
twilight See? Rude!
twilight Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated-
twilight Nevermind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?
twilight 
twilight And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor let alone marry him!
twilight I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!
twilight 
twilight We need to talk. I think you're making a big-
twilight She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
twilight She isn't just unpleasant and rude, she's downright evil!
twilight Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help-
twilight Dresses? What are you-?
twilight "New" bridesmaids? What happened to her "old" bridesmaids?
twilight Looks like I really am on my own.
twilight [church organ music]
twilight I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her. And neither should you!
twilight You have to listen to me!
twilight I'm fine.
twilight I've got something to say! She's evil!
twilight She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
twilight Because you're evil!
twilight Evil! And if I don't stop you you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
twilight 
twilight 
twilight I was just trying to-
twilight I was-
twilight Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
twilight He was my big brother, best friend
twilight Forever...
twilight And now, we'll never do anything
twilight Together...
twilight [smashing noise]
twilight I'm sorry!
twilight "Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."  my brother?
twilight How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
twilight But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
twilight Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
twilight Cadance, it's me! Twilight!
twilight She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells tingling]...
twilight I just lost a brother. I'm sorry.
twilight  Hello? Is anyone there?
twilight 
twilight Where am I?
twilight Help! Help!
twilight Plans? What plans?
twilight Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!
twilight Likely story! 
twilight ...and do a little shake.
twilight You remember me!
twilight We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
twilight We will. We just have to find... there!
twilight Stop!
twilight 
twilight Princess Celestia!
twilight Rarity!
twilight Go, go!
twilight They're changelings, remember?
twilight Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
twilight It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
twilight Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
twilight [electric sounds]
twilight Your spell! Perform your spell!
twilight Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the Changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?
twilight Love is in bloom
twilight A beautiful bride, a handsome groom,
twilight Two hearts becoming one
twilight A bond that cannot be undone because
twilight Love is in bloom
twilight A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
twilight I said love is in bloom
twilight You're starting a life and making room
twilight For us (For us, For us....)
twilight Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
twilight Now this was a great wedding.
twilight Where are all my quills? No, no, no, no, no...ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes 1-36! Where is it? Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me on everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards.
twilight Just a test? JUST A TEST? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!
twilight Ahem.
twilight You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills. And plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry! Sorry!
twilight The Crystal Empire? I-I'm sorry, I thought I'd studied. I don't think there's anything in any of my books--
twilight You want me to help protect an entire empire?
twilight How do I begin?
twilight My brother is there?
twilight But what if I fail?
twilight But what if--
twilight Mm-hm.
twilight I was prepared to do my best
twilight Thought I could handle any test
twilight For I can do so many tricks
twilight But I wasn't prepared for this
twilight Levitation would have been a breeze
twilight Facts and figures I recite with ease
twilight The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
twilight I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss
twilight But I wasn't prepared for this
twilight Will I fail, or will I pass?
twilight I can't be sure...
twilight My mind is sharp, my skills intact
twilight My heart is pure...
twilight Oh, I've taken my share of licks
twilight I've made it through the thin and thick
twilight But no I wasn't
twilight Oh no, I wasn't
twilight No I wasn't
twilight Prepared... for this!
twilight Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire!
twilight Are you sure? Absolutely sure?
twilight King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
twilight Yes.
twilight If you think of anything, even the smallest thing...
twilight Maybe the others are having better luck.
twilight C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together!
twilight Princess Cadance needs our help
twilight Her magic will not last forever
twilight I think we can do it
twilight But we need to work together
twilight We have to get this right
twilight Yes we have to make them see
twilight We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
twilight Oh, we have to get this right
twilight Yes we have to make them see
twilight We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
twilight And the Crystal Kingdom anthem
twilight Can you learn it in a day?
twilight Oh, we have to get this right
twilight Yes we have to make them see
twilight We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
twilight It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you!
