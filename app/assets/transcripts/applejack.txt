01 01 Yeehaw!
01 01 
01 01 Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like making new friends!
01 01 So, what can I do you for?
01 01 We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
01 01 Soup's on, everypony!
01 01 
01 01 Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
01 01 This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.
01 01 Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
01 01 Are you all right, sugarcube?
01 01 [train whistle blowing]
01 01  Whoa there, Nelly...
01 02 Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?
01 02 No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
01 02 And it ain't natural. Folk say it don't work the same as Equestria.
01 02 Rainbow, quit it.
01 02 Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
01 02 Let go.
01 02 No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
01 02 Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
01 02 YEE-HAW! Get along, little doggie.
01 02 Whoa! All yours, partner.
01 02 Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
01 02 It's just mud. Ahh!
01 02 
01 02 
01 02 That's what all the fuss is about?
01 02 Twilight, wait for us.
01 02 Whoa. Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
01 02 What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
01 02 Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
01 02 Twilight, where are you?
01 02 Come on!
01 02 Everypony okay?
01 02 Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
01 03 Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of granny's girdles. 
01 03  The Grand Galloping Gala!
01 03 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 03 The Grand Galloping Gala! 
01 03 Woo-hoo!
01 03 Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles till the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip. Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
01 03 Rainbow Dash, you told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing, spyin'?
01 03 Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.  I asked for that ticket first.
01 03 Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket. 
01 03 Drummin' up business for the farm?
01 03 Money t' fix granny's hip.
01 03 Okay.
01 03 
01 03 Wait just another minute.
01 03 No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
01 03 Did somepony say lunch?
01 03 I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?
01 03 Is that a yes?
01 03 So, that's a maybe?
01 03 Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.
01 03 We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
01 03 Twilight, you don't have to do that.
01 03 Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
01 03 Whoa Nelly!
01 03 
01 03 
01 03 
01 04 Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop a' apples I ever laid eyes on.
01 04 Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
01 04 Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
01 04 Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
01 04 Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddle the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself. 
01 04 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 04 Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
01 04 YEEHAW!
01 04 [ponies cheer]
01 04 Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!
01 04 Come on, little doggies! Turn!  Winona, put 'em up! Ha hah! Gotcha. 
01 04 Attagirl.  Yee haw!
01 04 [ponies cheer]
01 04 Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
01 04 I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
01 04 Yee haw!
01 04 I'm here. I'm here.   Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy.  It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo.
01 04 Ooo-ooo.
01 04  Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and  and stuff.  Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.
01 04 [sounds of dragging metal]
01 04   Phew.  O-oah.
01 04 Whoops.
01 04 
01 04 
01 04 Oh, howdy Twilight.
01 04 It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
01 04 Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
01 04 'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
01 04  They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?
01 04 Could you step aside, Twilight?
01 04 Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
01 04 Help? No way, no how.
01 04 Is that a challenge?
01 04 Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.
01 04  I'm a might' sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
01 04 Uh... Yeah.
01 04 Isn't that a might' dangerous?
01 04 Well, alrighty then. Oh my.
01 04 
01 04 Got it.   
01 04 You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this.  Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.
01 04 Heh heh... Here I go!
01 04 You're welcome!
01 04 Ow!
01 04 Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
01 04 Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
01 04 You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?
01 04 Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
01 04 That's quite neighborly of her.
01 04 Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
01 04 What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
01 04 Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
01 04 WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
01 04 Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
01 04 Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
01 04 Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
01 04 A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
01 04 Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
01 04 If you say so.
01 04 Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
01 04   What? Huh?  
01 04 Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight.  I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
01 04 Hardy har.  And no I don't.
01 04 Help? No thanks.  A little more...  Little...  There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on  apples  fall off .
01 04 I knew that.
01 04 You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
01 04 Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
01 04 Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
01 04 Fine. Can we just get on with it?
01 04 I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
01 04 That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!
01 04 We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.
01 04 Must  keep  buckin'... just  a few  more. Must finish harvestin'.
01 04  Ha! No I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?
01 04  Where'd all the apple...?  
01 04 Huh?
01 04 Okay, Twilight.
01 04 Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.
01 04 How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!  Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.
01 04 Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
01 05  Land sakes!
01 05 
01 05 [squeaky toy]
01 05 Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
01 05 Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
01 05 Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play.
01 06 Nothin' at all, 'cept in when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.
01 06 That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
01 06 Can your magical powers do this?
01 06 [banjo music]
01 06 Top that, missy.
01 06 Whoa! Uh!
01 06 A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
01 06 It's gorgeous.
01 06 Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!
01 06 All hat and no cattle.
01 06 Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
01 06 Mm-hmm.
01 07 What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
01 07 Huh?
01 07 
01 07 Yaaa!
01 07 [pop whistles]
01 07 Let's go!
01 07 Looks pretty cold up there.
01 07 Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers an all.
01 07 I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
01 07 Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split.
01 07  We. Made. It. 
01 07 You could just leap on over.
01 07 That's it.
01 07 Everypony okay?
01 07 Aw, no big whoop, sugar cube.
01 07 Wha! Wha...
01 07 What's that, sugarcube?
01 07 All of us are scared of that dragon.
01 07 Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
01 07 Now what?
01 07 What in tarnation...?
01 07 Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
01 08 
01 08  Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
01 08 Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
01 08  Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.
01 08 [rain pouring down]
01 08 Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
01 08 Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.
01 08 What now?
01 08 Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so.
01 08 Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
01 08 Does so.
01 08 Does so.
01 08 Does so.
01 08 Does so infinity. Hah.
01 08 I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
01 08 I'm not sayin' anythin'.
01 08 Y'all just be on yer way, then.
01 08 Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast.
01 08 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 08 Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta.
01 08 Twilight?
01 08 Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
01 08 Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
01 08  If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.
01 08  What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?
01 08 Slumber 101: Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night.  Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.
01 08 Blahch. What in the world is this for?
01 08 Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'!
01 08 Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
01 08 You betcha. 
01 08 You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
01 08 Yay.
01 08 Just fine, Rarity.
01 08 Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
01 08 That's not a real story. You made it up.
01 08  
01 08 Nah, ya just eat 'em.  Mmm-mmm! 
01 08 Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon.
01 08 Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.
01 08 And I think the truth is some pony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
01 08 I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
01 08 Hah!
01 08  
01 08  Happy?
01 08 I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
01 08 I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
01 08 I will if she will.
01 08 My hooves ain't muddy.
01 08 There ain't. See?
01 08 Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
01 08 Hey!
01 08 Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!
01 08 Ah.
01 08 Um, yeah?
01 08 Can't hear ya, I'm asleep. 
01 08 I ain't budgin'.
01 08 Give it back!
01 08 Yes, you will!
01 08 : Will!
01 08 : Will!
01 08 : Will!
01 08 I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
01 08 No, it was me.
01 08 Me!
01 08 
01 08 Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
01 08 Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'.
01 08 No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
01 08 Well, ya should'a tried harder.  I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.
01 08 What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
01 08 We gotta do somethin'!
01 08  Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, alright?
01 08 I said I'm sorry! I should'a listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!
01 08 Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help.
01 08 
01 08 Better?
01 08 
01 08 Is it bigger than a barn?
01 08  We're never gonna guess what y'er thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.
01 08 She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
01 08 Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
01 08 It is?
01 08 
01 08 If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
01 08 Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
01 08 That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.
01 08 Ugh. Are not.
01 08 Are not!
01 08 Are not.
01 08 
01 08 
01 08 
01 08 Whu, which is it?  Whoa! That mess is your fault, not mine. 
01 08 
01 08 
01 08 
01 09 We're hidin' from her!
01 09 [All gasp]
01 09 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 09 Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
01 09 No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
01 09 So I swept her up and brought her here.
01 09 For safe keepin'.
01 09 Not from that creepy Zecora.
01 09 Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept.... her!
01 09 That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!
01 09 [Crash that sounds like a thunderclap]
01 09 The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
01 09 All on their own!
01 09 Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
01 09 Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
01 09  That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!
01 09 Apple Bloom?
01 09 You get back here right now!
01 09 Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
01 09 [Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity speak over each other against Zecora]
01 09 And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
01 09 Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
01 09 Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.
01 09 [dream sequence]
01 09 Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.
01 09 [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
01 09 [Spike and Twilight gasp]
01 09 It's a curse, I tells ya!
01 09 Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!
01 09 I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
01 09 Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
01 09 Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!
01 09 No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
01 09 Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'M GONNA TELL Big McIntosh ON YOU! Aw pony feathers.
01 09 Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddyup pony!
01 09 YEEE-HAW!
01 09 No, Rainbow Dash. Other way.
01 09 I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!
01 09 Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.
01 09 
01 09  Apple Bloom! You're okay!
01 09 What in the hay does that mean?
01 09 ... Will somepony please talk normal?
01 09 LITTLE JOKES?! Very funny.
01 09 I'm right here little sis. I ain't tiny no more!
01 10 Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. HEY!
01 10  I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
01 10 Yeeeeeee-haw!
01 10 Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash. Hold on girls, we're almost there.
01 10 Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
01 10 Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
01 10 Looks like our problems are solved.
01 10 Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
01 10  My apples!
01 10 No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
01 10 Brace yourself y'all, here they come.  Didn't see that one comin'.
01 10 So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
01 11 But the food we've stored is runnin' out
01 11 And we can't grow in this cold
01 11 'Cause tomorrow spring–
01 11 No easy task to clear the ground
01 11 Plant our tiny seeds
01 11 With proper care and sunshine
01 11 Everyone it feeds
01 11 Apples, carrots, celery stalks
01 11 Colorful flowers too
01 11 We must work so very hard
01 11 It's just so much to do!
01 11 Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it Bumpkin, I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
01 11 Oh, just dandy. Little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear ya hear. We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow high-tailed outta here.
01 11 Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
01 11 Well, I never turn down a hard worker but...
01 11 Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
01 11 And what in tarnation does that mean?
01 11 What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?
01 11 Nuts Twilight, you used magic.
01 11 That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MAH farm.
01 11 Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
01 11 I'm tellin' you Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
01 11 Go.
01 11 Go.
01 11 GO!
01 11 And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
01 11 Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
01 11 Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
01 11 
01 12 Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Every pony gets one eventually.
01 12 'course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I know my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.  Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh.
01 12 Get your delicious nutritious apples here!
01 12 Heh... she's so creative, heh.
01 12 You forgot your change!
01 12 I'm sorry ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just...
01 12 Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. ...and these. ...and these.
01 12 Y'all come back now, y'hear?
01 12 Sorry little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
01 12 Home. Now.
01 12 Ugh. Listen sugar-cube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
01 12 Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
01 12 Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
01 12 Yeah. I'm sure.
01 12 [knock on the door]
01 12 Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
01 12 And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
01 12 [ponies chatter]
01 13 Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
01 13 I know I can.  Oh, for Pete's sake!
01 13 All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl.
01 13 Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw.
01 13  Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.
01 13 Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.
01 13 Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better, heh heh heh.
01 13 Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gilding the lily.
01 13 Prove what?
01 13 You know what, Rainbow? You're on.
01 13 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 13 An Iron--
01 13 See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is--
01 13 To be our judge and keep score.
01 13  Dagnabbit.
01 13 You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
01 13  Nuts and chews! Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there.
01 13 Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!
01 13 What was the time on that, Spike?
01 13 18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?
01 13 Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 Mighty respectable,  but let me show ya how it's really done.  [bell rings]
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 Years of applebuckin'.
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 
01 13 [ponies cheer]
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13  Wuh
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 Be a good sport, Applejack.
01 13 
01 13 
01 13  That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win.
01 13  You're cheatin'!
01 13 I said... uh-oh. 
01 13 [crowd cheers]
01 13 [bell rings]
01 13 Only 'cause you cheated.
01 13 You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
01 13 Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
01 13 I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
01 13 Hah! Prove it.
01 13 Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
01 13 Hold on! There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
01 13 
01 13 
01 13 
01 13 The Iron phony, you mean.
01 13 I'm ready to run a good, clean race.
01 13 You are not allowed to use your wings.
01 13  Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
01 13 'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
01 13 
01 13 Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
01 13  But have you ever run a race?
01 13 Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck. 
01 13 Not so easy without wings, is it?
01 13 Whoa! I don't believe it.
01 13 Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
01 13 She did too!
01 13 What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.
01 13 See you at the finish line!
01 13 It is for you. Heh.
01 13 Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!
01 13  Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on.
01 13 Later!
01 13 Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?
01 13 No, I said no wings.
01 13 Whoa!
01 13 You do?
01 13 
01 13 Cut it out!
01 13 You started it.
01 13 Oh no, you won't.
01 13 Oh no, you don't.
01 13 No, I won!
01 13 Tied?!
01 13 For first?
01 13 LAST?
01 13 YOU?
01 13 What? How's that even possible?
01 13 You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.
01 13 Princess Celestia?!
01 13 W... What are you doin' here?
01 13 I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport, Princess.
01 13 Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?
01 14 Howdy, Rarity!
01 14 What do you think she's makin'?
01 14 Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
01 14 Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
01 14 Hm... Nah.
01 14 Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
01 14 So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?
01 14 They sure are... sumth'n.
01 14 And we're plum grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
01 14 Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
01 14 What if it rains? Galoshes!
01 14 Even if you simply have to fudge it
01 14 Why, they're the best duds I ever did see.
01 14 Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!
01 14 Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
01 14 Nah.  Okay, maybe a little.
01 14 Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
01 14 Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
01 14 Well, that's mighty big of you.
01 14 Oh, right. That.
01 15 Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?
01 15  Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Woah! Nyu-uh!
01 15 I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.
01 15 Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?
01 15 Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?
01 15  That's where Fluttershy's headed!
01 15 We better go and make sure she's okay.
01 15 I hope nothin'.
01 15 I'm tryin' not to think about it.
01 15 Just exploded? For no reason?
01 15 Of course not.
01 15 I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!
01 15 [dragonfly buzzing]
01 15 Fluttershy?
01 15 Phew, what a relief.
01 15 Um... Twilight?
01 15 Who cares? RUN!
01 15 [ponies screaming]
01 15 
01 15 What are you talking about Pink?
01 16 
01 16 Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
01 16 And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
01 16 Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder then the brass section of a marching band!
01 16 How'd you do that?
01 16 
01 16 And we came to cheer you to victory!
01 16 Yes!
01 16 Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
01 16 Hmm.. Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet? The competition's almost over.
01 16 Oh, don't worry about it kiddo.
01 18 We're almost there, youngin's.
01 18 Here we are.
01 18 Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.  Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC.
01 18 Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... Waaah!  Uh... house cleanin'?
01 18 [<a href="/wiki/My_Little_Pony_theme_song" title="My Little Pony theme song">theme song</a>]
01 18 [Birds chirping]
01 18 [All gasp]
01 18 Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?
01 18 Theme song?
01 18 Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!
01 18 The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
01 18 Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.
01 18 Uh... Yeah.
01 18 Uh...
01 18 "Speechless" is right.
01 18 Apple Bloom! You did it!
01 19 Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
01 19 Well, that sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that their hole and we'll save Rarity.
01 19 We can't muscle through it!
01 19 Huh. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
01 19 We gotta save her.
01 19 Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
01 19 Hoho there, lover boy.
01 19 Hold on there, little fella.
01 19 Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
01 19 Ho, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
01 19 Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!
01 19 Assist you with what?
01 21 An' that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, “Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.” So she sang her song, big an' strong, an' they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... End.
01 21 Heh... Uh... Well, ya know, being replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... An' Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
01 21 But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
01 21 Who you calling a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
01 21  They've got Bloomberg!
01 21 Braeburn, listen –
01 21 Braeburn, listen, something terrible has happened –
01 21 … Listen, Braeburn, I – Oof!
01 21 But, Braeburn, we –
01 21 Braeburn!
01 21 Braebu –
01 21 Brae –
01 21 BRAEBURN!
01 21 You have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a HU-UGE problem! Some of our friends are missing!
01 21 And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
01 21 Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em. Let's go!
01 21 Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?
01 21 That's weird. 'cause my cousin, Braeburn, here, wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
01 21 They busted their rumps here! An' now they're suppos't ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
01 21 Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
01 21 The settler ponies need it to LIVE!
01 21 I want my kin ta have what they need to live... But a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
01 21 Sheriff, if we could only –
01 21 Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!
01 22 Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.
01 22 Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!
01 22 What in tarnation?!
01 23 Get back here, you thievin' varmints!
01 23 Apple Bloom!
01 23 I never told you that story?
01 23 Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.
01 23  I didn't want to spend my life at a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in a big city. Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.
01 23  I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
01 23  What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.
01 23 I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
01 23 It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared.
01 23 I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since. There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
01 23 When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
01 23 Come here, y'all.
01 24 What's he all saddle sore about?
01 25 Howdy!
01 25 Are you kiddin’? Ah wouldn’t have missed it for the world.
01 25 Hooie! Ah am beat! I haven’t danced that much since… Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!
01 25 Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you ’round these parts?
01 25 This afternoon? A-as in, this afternoon this afternoon?
01 25 Uh, well, ah… ah… uh… ah don’t think I can make it ’cause… uh… ah have to… uh… uh, you know what? Ah… uh… pick apples! Yep, apples! ’Cause that’s what we do! With the… apples. We, uh… pick ’em! [nervous chuckle] 
01 25 
01 25 
01 25 Oh! Howdy, pardn’r!
01 25 No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean… you can’t come in here!
01 25 Oh, well, she was just bringin’ in some… supplies! Yup, supplies for the… renovation! Fixin’ up the whole thing, top to bottom… uh, lots of construction goin’ on in there right now.
01 25 Yup! Construction! That’s my story, and I’m stickin’ to it. [nervous laugh]
01 25 [relieved sigh]
01 25 [rest of ponies sigh in relief]
01 25 [in unison] Surprise!
01 25 Why in the world would you think we didn’t like you anymore, sugarcube?
01 25 All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let’s party!
01 25 Uh-huh, sure!
01 26 Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
01 26 Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
01 26 We're gonna be a mite busy.
01 26 At the Gala (it's amazing!), I will sell them (better hurry!)
01 26 All my appletastic treats! (yummy, yummy!)
01 26 Hungry ponies (they'll be snacking!), they will buy them (bring your money!)
01 26 Caramel apples, apple sweets! (gimme some!)
01 26 And I'll earn a lot of money for the Apple family!
01 26 Sell some apples
01 26 To sell!
01 26 Howdy, partner! You hungry?
01 26 Well, what's you're hungering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?
01 26 Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yeehaw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.
01 26 First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales.  This ain't what I expected at all.
01 26 ...let it slip by.
01 26 Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
01 26 It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered.
01 26 Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
01 26 Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
01 26 As horrible as our night was...
02 01 Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!
02 01 Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
02 01 And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
02 01 So you know who we are, big deal.
02 01 What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started?
02 01 Yee-haw!
02 01 What in tarnation? Where am I?
02 01 Who are y'all?
02 01 All right then, I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?
02 01 No! Our friendship? Over?!
02 01 It can't be true. It just can't!
02 01 That just can't be the truth.
02 01 I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
02 01 Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going.
02 01 I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie.
02 01 
02 01 Chocolate milk.
02 01 Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us.
02 02 Our friendship...over?
02 02 Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
02 02 Uh...Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
02 02 Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that.
02 02 I absolutely refuse.
02 02 I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike.
02 02 I don't have any book.
02 02 Beats me.
02 02 
02 02 Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
02 02 I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
02 02 And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me.
02 02 Oh, now you want to fight. Where were you when I was battlin' Discord?
02 02 Wh-what happened? Twilight!  I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?
02 02 She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
02 02 The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
02 02 Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!
02 02 That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
02 03 Yes ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D.
02 03 I'd take cover if I were you.
02 03 You alright, hun?
02 03 [various shock statements]
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 Yes?
02 03 [sighs of relief]
02 03 
02 03 No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
02 03 Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
02 03 Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
02 03 Not almost!
02 03 Whoa nelly.
02 03 Uh, What are we gonna do, y'all?
02 03 It wasn't her fault!
02 03 So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
02 03 Mmhmm.
02 03 [All right, etc]
02 03 
02 03 Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter. [clears throat]
02 03 Dear Princess Celestia, we're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
02 03 Signed, your loyal subjects.
02 03 
02 04 Howdy Spike, hey Twilight! Nice costume.
02 04 With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
02 04 While y'all here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
02 04 [cheering and applauding]
02 04 Whoop. Careful there, partner. 
02 04 "Fit in"? Really?
02 04 I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
02 04 You can do it, princess!
02 04 Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria, princess.
02 04 Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
02 04 What are you gonna do?
02 04 Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?
02 05 'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
02 05 Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
02 05 It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?
02 05 Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do.
02 05 Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!
02 05 Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!
02 05 
02 05 Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!
02 05 [more laughing]
02 05 Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
02 05 Together!
02 05 Apple Bloom! You're up!
02 05 Apple Bloom...
02 05 How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
02 05 Apple Bloom!
02 05 Yee-haw!
02 05 Way to corral some critters, sis!
02 05 What?!
02 05 H- Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.
02 05 Yeah, um-
02 05 Heh, um, actually, I-
02 05  Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
02 05 But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
02 05 He sure is a cutie.
02 05 It's almost time!
02 05 AB and I figured since we do this every year...
02 05 Sister for a day.
02 05 [deep breath]
02 05  We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
02 05 Mm-hmm.
02 05 Yeah!
02 05 
02 06 
02 06 [more cheering]
02 06 Yee haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right Big McIntosh?
02 06 I've never seen anythin' like it, have you Big Mac?
02 06 Why Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
02 06 Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?
02 06  What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? Three cutie marks?!
02 06 C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!
02 06 Well I know somepony who might!
02 06 Cutie pox?!
02 06 Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!
02 06 No known cure?!
02 06 My sister's speakin' in fancy!
02 06 I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
02 06 Zecora!
02 06 Hurry, hurry!
02 06 But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
02 06 Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!
02 06 Come again?
02 06 Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
02 06 Somepony! Anypony!
02 06 I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
02 06 What?!
02 07 Let's get this thing started!
02 07 Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.
02 07 Same time every week.
02 07 Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us...
02 07 I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
02 07 Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
02 07 Tortoise!
02 07 It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
02 07 A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.
02 07 [camera clicks]
02 07 [tortoise yelps]
02 07 Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
02 08 And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
02 08 [ponies cheering]
02 08 Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
02 08 Immorta-what?
02 08 [camera clicking]
02 08 Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
02 08 And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
02 08 I stopped the carriage bus with these babies. Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
02 08 But a real hero doesn't brag.
02 08 ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
02 08 I think we're getting off topic here.
02 09 Listen to her. She's so excited to see us she can hardly talk.
02 09 How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?
02 10 You bet they are, birthday boy.
02 10 C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
02 10 Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?
02 10  Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh.
02 10 Twilight, get my rope.
02 10 Help!
02 10 Get us out of here right now!
02 10  What was that?
02 11 Whooowee! Canterlot, here we come!
02 11 There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
02 11 It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
02 11 The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
02 11 Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?
02 11 Uh-
02 11 Ugh.
02 11 [under her breath] That'd be a first.
02 11 Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we--
02 11 Actually, we're all out.
02 11 [under her breath] Where should I start?
02 11 It feels like we're going in circles.
02 11 Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and-
02 11 Yeah, uh-
02 11 Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship, heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down.
02 11 You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
02 11 Secretary.
02 11 Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.
02 11 And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food.
02 11 How about 'Earth'?
02 11 I agree. Let's all calm down.
02 11 I know, I know.
02 11  
02 11 [windigo roaring]
02 11 
02 11 Windigos?
02 11 Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too.
02 11 
02 11 [windigo snorts]
02 11 
02 11 Well, I don't hate you guys either.
02 11 No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.
02 11 [ice cracking]
02 11 I didn't know unicorns could do that.
02 11 Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings.
02 12 
02 12 [pots and pans banging, continues under]
02 12 Yay, the zap apples are comin'!
02 12 
02 12 There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
02 12 [springing sounds]
02 12 I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen.
02 12 I'm sorry Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
02 12 The zap apple harvest has begun!
02 12 
02 12 So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
02 12 Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
02 12 
02 12 
02 13 Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
02 13 Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus, and the other one a unicorn?
02 13 Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm a' hungry caterpillars headed this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
02 14 
02 14 [tap on wood]
02 14 Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so.
02 14 Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches.
02 14 Buuut, this here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.
02 14 You betcha, Granny Smith.
02 14 You betcha, Mayor.
02 14 I'll do better than my best!
02 14 Guess that means me.
02 14 Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
02 14 Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.
02 14 Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?
02 14 Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.
02 14 No big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.
02 14 Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing A-okay.
02 14 Well I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!
02 14 Sure am, Miss Jubilee.
02 14 What are you all doing here?
02 14 Fine.
02 14 What are you five up to?
02 14 Uhuh. Well, just remember: No talking about Ponyville.
02 14 Canterlot was fine.
02 14 Yes.
02 14 Some.
02 14 Yes, saw 'em both.
02 14 Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.
02 14 Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation being orchard folk and all.
02 14 Yes.
02 14 No, 'cuz it was none of her business!
02 14 No!
02 14 NO!
02 14 [gears turning]
02 14 No no NO! I'm not telling you why, so just–
02 14 You promise not to ask me any questions?
02 14 That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherry changa.
02 14 No! Make it stop, make it stop!
02 14 Never!
02 14 Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.
02 14  I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
02 14 
02 14 Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!
02 14 Whoa! What the hay?
02 14 Hey! Cut that out! Whoa! [to coach ponies] I'll pay you double to outrun them.
02 14 I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
02 14 [horses neighing, engine revving]
02 14 Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!
02 14 Pinkie, I did not break my promise!
02 14 If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come to breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
02 14 I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't.
02 14 Yes. Hyah!
02 14 [train whistle]
02 14 
02 14 Yee-haw!
02 14 Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts.
02 14 Fine. Now you know.
02 14 Well, just look!
02 14 Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.
02 14 That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come back empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.
02 14 So... you're not upset, or disappointed?
02 14 But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
02 14 Dear Princess Celestia, it's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
02 15 [through megaphone] Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!
02 15 Heh, Sorry everypony! That's it for today!
02 15 Hold on everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-
02 15 And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
02 15 If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
02 15 What in Equestria is that?
02 15 
02 15 Uh, sure, I guess.
02 15 I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way.
02 15 Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
02 15 Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
02 15 You wouldn't dare.
02 15 I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
02 15 You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
02 15 Our cider speaks for itself!
02 15 We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
02 15 [sounds of exertion]
02 15 Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
02 15 Thanks Twilight. We'll need it.
02 15 Ready!
02 15 Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel!
02 15 
02 15 [dings and buzzes]
02 15 C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
02 15 Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!
02 15 I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
02 15 Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!
02 15 There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
02 15 Thanks.
02 15 We... lost?
02 15 No Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal.
02 15 Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.
02 15 Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay.
02 15 They're gone.
02 15 Dear Princess Celestia. I wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already too.
02 15 
02 16 [whooshing noises]
02 16  Is she gonna be okay?
02 16 I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
02 16 Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
02 16 Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
02 16 Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
02 16 What's all the ruckus?
02 16 There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus-
02 16 ...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
02 20 What kind of disaster?
02 20 The perimeter's clear.
02 21  Me neither.
02 21  You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
02 21  What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?
02 21 
02 21 But why would you want to, Spike?
02 23 [voice vibrating] You said it, ooh.
02 23 She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!
02 23 “Applejack, asleep on the job!” Can y'all believe this?! And this one: “Big McIntosh – what's he hiding?” Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?
02 23 Yup.
02 23 Nope.
02 24 Uh, beg pardon but, could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy, right Big McIntosh?
02 24 Phooey on the festivities, I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
02 24 
02 24 Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.
02 24 Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
02 24 What is it?
02 24 Uh, you're investigatin'?
02 25 
02 25 [running footsteps]
02 25 Well, color me pleased as punch!
02 25 Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight, that's great news!
02 25 As one of your P.F.F.'s...  Pony Friends Forever...
02 25 ... I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
02 25 Why the long face, sugarcube?
02 25 Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.
02 25 And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
02 25 Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bitesize apple fritter you ever tasted...
02 25 Hiya, Princess!
02 25 Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
02 25 Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go?  I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
02 25 
02 25 Spike! That goes on the cake.
02 25 Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
02 25 Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
02 25 She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love love love it if we'd fill in for them.
02 25 And you had your doubts about her.
02 25 [excited chatter]
02 25 Ya sure about that?
02 25 C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess.
02 26 I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
02 26 Rarity!
02 26 OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!
02 26 Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
03 01 I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considering.
03 01 
03 01 Twilight! Did you pass?
03 01 Made sweets with crystal berries
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
03 01 Oh, we have to get this right
03 01 Yes we have to make them see
03 01 We can save the Crystal Ponies... with their history!
03 01 Can you handle the mission?
